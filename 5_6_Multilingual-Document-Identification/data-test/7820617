Formed in the early 70's in Miami, Florida, Critical Mass brandishes their version of melodic power pop from roots in The Sex Pistols, The Ramones, The Stranglers to The Beatles and Cheap Trick. The band's first self produced demo, a two song 45 of "Silver Screen" backed with "No One Left To Blame" released in 1978, has become a sought after example of Florida's first punk band. Underground punk aficionados craving rare unheard late 70's punk rock can find copies on eBay commanding hundreds of dollars. Ryan Richardson of BreakMyFace.com calls it a swamplands gem". Since its inception Critical Mass developed a reputation as the band to see as well as hear. Band founder and singer songwriter Mick Fazz became famous for not only rocking crowds with eclectic mixes of strong original material but also performances of tunes by “The Sex Pistols“, “The Stranglers“, and “Jethro Tull“, material considered very unconventional for bar bands of the day. Fazz also became famous for his captivating on stage persona and in crowd antics including being chased by the nightclubs chef with a meat cleaver as he ran through the audience with a T-Bone hanging from his mouth. After a couple of years of self promoted concerts, gigs at local Big Daddy's night clubs and sending out tapes by the dozens interest soon followed. The band began playing showcases for major record labels like Capitol, RCA, RSO and MCA. These showcases included a gig at Tramp's in New York City arranged by legendary Beatles promoter Sid Bernstein. This showcase led to a  debut album deal with a five album option on MCA records.  Recording began at Chris Squire's Studio in England in the fall of ’79 with production by Onward US, a company jointly owned by radio mover and shaker Lee Abrams and Yes bassist Chris Squire. That album, ”It's What's Inside That Counts“, layered Mick Fazz's melodic vocals and the dual-guitar assault of Mick Fazz and Dave Owen for a classic power pop, or what might then have been considered New Wave-ish, sound with a hard rock edge and pop songwriting components. The album was released on the MCA label Oct 3, 1980. The group spent the rest of that year and much of 1981 touring. Critical Mass then changed its band line up as guitarist Dave Owen and drummer Mike Barone left the band, with bassist Henry LaPlume staying on board Added to the line up were Frank Prinzel and Tom Vasquez respectively. Prinzel having been a previous member and part of the 1978 two song 45 quartet which had included Tom McWilliams on drums and Al Schwartz on bass. This iteration of Critical Mass did some touring and headed into Criteria Studios to begin recording material for a follow up album to “It's What's Outside That Counts“. Critical Mass was paired with the sibling production and engineering team of Ron and Howard Albert. Atlantic and Polydor records had expressed interest in the band but the music scene was changing and the hard edge of punk and new wave was succumbing to  the more processed offerings of hair bands and Sade. The band produced some respectable offerings but alas, the “industry” wasn't biting. The current Critical Mass lineup features Frank Patterson on Bass. Frank has been playing in the Central Florida area for about 20 years. The bulk of that time as a guitarist and bassist for Jill Towers & Heat. One of the most popular bands in Central Florida during the 80s and 90s. The drummer for The Mass is Phil Fleetwood, who's background includes The Generators, a band that recorded 3 albums and was featured on the nationally released Breakout USA CD. Issued by The Westwood One Radio Network, the project featured the top 15 unsigned bands in the country in 1991. After a quarter century Mick and the Mass are releasing another self produced offering entitled, “It’s What Counts That’s Inside“. The project is a result of a partnering of Mick and former Mass alum Frank Prinzel. Using the resources of the Internet as a vehicle to once again present Critical Mass’ music to the world, "It’s What Counts That’s Inside" serves up more of that hard rock edge and pop songwriting style in a scorching, head banging, moshing, frenzy.

Iako su Rumunji u tim područjima činili većinu, ta područja su uglavnom bila multietnička a prijašnje stanovništvo, napose Mađari nisu se htjeli odreći određenih privilegija. Rumunjska je gotovo  udvostručila površinu i broj stanovnika, što je utjecalo da do tad etnički homogena Rumunjska postane multietnička iako su Rumunji i dalje činili veliku većinu. Takvo stanje rezultiralo je raznim trzavicama između manjina i Rumunjske većine.
