The town grew on the lumber demand for buildings in Denver and by the 1880s, the town could boast a population of 200 people and six operating sawmills. Improvement of the road from Denver up Bear Creek Canyon in 1911 and electrical service reaching the town in 1917 spurred further growth and the town became a popular summer destination for Denver residents. Resorts like Troutdale-in-the-Pines, Greystone Guest Ranch and the Brook Forest Inn opened and entertained Denverites and celebrities including film stars of the day and Presidents Franklin D. Roosevelt and Theodore Roosevelt, who both vacationed at the Troutdale. In the 1950s, improved utilities in town and the rising popularity of automobiles began to entice more future residents to stay year-round and the town became known as a commuter community. There were 3,591 households out of which 36.1% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 65.6% were married couples living together, 6.5% had a female householder with no husband present, and 25.1% were non-families. 19.2% of all households were made up of individuals and 3.5% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older.  The average household size was 2.56 and the average family size was 2.94. In the CDP the population was spread out with 25.9% under the age of 18, 4.6% from 18 to 24, 29.6% from 25 to 44, 31.7% from 45 to 64, and 8.2% who were 65 years of age or older.  The median age was 41 years. For every 100 females there were 99.4 males.  For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 96.6 males. The median income for a household in the CDP was $79,380, and the median income for a family was $88,589. Males had a median income of $62,917 versus $37,392 for females.

In the winter, skiing and snowboarding is available at nearby Echo Mountain Park and ice skating is offered at Evergreen Lake. The skating season usually runs from mid December to late March depending upon ice thickness and weather. Meanwhile, the ski season at new Echo Mountain Park lasts often from late November to early May, again depending on weather. Echo Mountain Park borders Evergreen, making it a quasi-ski town only 20 minutes west of Denver. Predicated on the low humidity it is common to see residents walk around in their short sleeve shirts in the middle of winter, and predicated on the high altitude there is little need of screens in the summer, due to a lack of flies. In early spring hundreds of elk descend down to residents homes where they feed unbothered by their human neighbors. Two risks associated with living in Evergreen are the occasional mountain lion that poses a risk to humans and pets and driving, which can be quite treacherous.
