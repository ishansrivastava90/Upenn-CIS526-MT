Schmitt trigger devices are typically used in open loop configurations for noise immunity and closed loop positive feedback configurations to implement multivibrators. A Schmitt trigger can be implemented with a simple tunnel diode, a diode with an "N"-shaped current–voltage characteristic in the first quadrant. An oscillating input will cause the diode to move from one rising leg of the "N" to the other and back again as the input crosses the rising and falling switching thresholds. However, the performance of this Schmitt trigger can be improved with transistor-based devices that make explicit use of positive feedback to implement the switching. A practical Schmitt trigger configuration is shown below. The output characteristic has exactly the same shape of the previous basic configuration, and the threshold values are the same as well. On the other hand, in the previous case, the output voltage was depending on the power supply, while now it is defined by the Limitations of real op-amps''). In the high state, the output voltage is close to V+, but in the low state it is still well above V−. This may not be low enough to be a "logical zero " for digital circuits. This may require additional amplifiers following the trigger circuit. Schmitt triggers are typically used in open loop configurations for noise immunity and closed loop positive feedback configurations to implement multivibrators. One application of a Schmitt trigger is to increase the noise immunity in a circuit with only a single input threshold. With only one input threshold, a noisy input signal near that threshold could cause the output to switch rapidly back and forth from noise alone. A noisy Schmitt Trigger input signal near one threshold can cause only one switch in output value, after which it would have to move beyond the other threshold in order to cause another switch. For example, in amplified infrared photodiode generates an electric signal that switches frequently between its absolute lowest value and its absolute highest value. This signal is then low-pass filtered to form a smooth signal that rises and falls corresponding to the relative amount of time the switching signal is on and off. That filtered output passes to the input of a Schmitt trigger. The net effect is that the output of the Schmitt trigger only passes from low to high after a received infrared signal excites the photodiode for longer than some known delay, and once the Schmitt trigger is high, it only moves low after the infrared signal ceases to excite the photodiode for longer than a similar known delay. Whereas the photodiode is prone to spurious switching due to noise from the environment, the delay added by the filter and Schmitt trigger ensures that the output only switches when there is certainly an input stimulating the device.
