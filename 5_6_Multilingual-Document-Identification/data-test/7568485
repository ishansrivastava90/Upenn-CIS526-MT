The Kushans are believed to have been predominantly Indian culture like the other nomadic groups who had invaded India. The first great Kushan emperor Wima Kadphises may have embraced Saivism, as surmised by coins minted during the period. The following Kushan emperors represented a wide variety of faiths including Zoroastrianism, Buddhism, and possibly Saivism. The rule of the Kushans linked the seagoing trade of the Indian Ocean with the commerce of the Silk Road through the long-civilized Indus Valley. At the height of the dynasty, the Kushans loosely oversaw a territory that extended to the Aral Sea through present-day Uzbekistan, Afghanistan, and Pakistan into northern India. The loose unity and comparative peace of such a vast expanse encouraged long-distance trade, brought Chinese silks to Rome, and created strings of flourishing urban centers. These conquests probably took place sometime between 45 and 60 CE, and laid the basis for the Kushan Empire which was rapidly expanded by his descendants. Kanishka is renowned in Buddhist tradition for having convened a great Buddhist council in Harsha Vardhana, Kanishka is considered by Buddhism as one of its greatest benefactors.

The Kushans are again recorded to have sent presents to the Chinese court in Han Huan. Following these interactions, cultural exhanges further increased, and Kushan Buddhist missionaries, such as Lokaksema, became active in the Chinese capital cities of Loyang and sometimes Nanjing, where they particularly distinguished themselves by their translation work. They were the first recorded promoters of Hinayana and Mahayana scriptures in China, greatly contributing to the Silk Road transmission of Buddhism. From the 3rd century the Kushan empire began to fragment. Around 225 Vasudeva I died and the Kushan empire was divided into western and eastern halves. Around 224–240, the Sasanians invaded Bactria and Northern India, where they are known as the Indo-Sassanians. Around 270, the Kushans lost their territories on the Gangetic plain, where the Gupta Empire was established around 320. During the middle of the 4th century CE a Kushan vassal in Pakistan, named Kidara, rose to power and overthrew the old Kushan dynasty.  He created a kingdom known as the Kidarite Kingdom, although he probably considered himself a Kushan, as indicated by the Kushan style of his coins. The Kidarite seem to have been rather prosperous, although on a smaller scale than their Kushan predecessors. These remnants of the Kushan empire were ultimately wiped out in the 5th century by the invasions of the White Huns, and later the expansion of Islam. ---->
