The shooting became particularly controversial because contemporaneous and later police and media accounts contradicted each other, specifically regarding Menezes's manner and clothing as he entered the station, and whether there had been any police warnings before the firing. The death sparked an intense public debate over an apparent change in police policy, in which a shoot to kill practice known as Operation Kratos had been introduced to deal with terrorist threats. On the day of the shooting, the police were hunting four men believed to be involved in the failed bombing the day before. Intelligence had linked the men to a block of flats in Plain clothes officers, armed with pistols for self-defence only, followed him as he took a bus to Brixton tube station, before boarding another to Stockwell tube station because the tube station at Brixton was closed. Specialist firearms officers were called to Stockwell. Just after Menezes entered a train, one of the unnamed officers shot him dead. The train was still at the platform with its doors open. Menezes, an electrician, lived in one of the flats with two of his cousins, and had just received a call to fix a broken Kilburn. On the basis of Tango Ten's suspicion, Gold Command authorised officers to continue pursuit and surveillance, and that the suspect was to be prevented from entering the Tube system. Three surveillance officers, codenamed Hotel 1, Hotel 3 and Hotel 9, followed Menezes on to the train. According to Hotel 3, Menezes sat down with a glass panel to his right about two seats in. Hotel 3 then took a seat on the left with about two or three passengers between Menezes and himself. When the firearms officers arrived on the platform, Hotel 3 moved to the door, blocked it from closing with his left foot, and shouted 'He's here!' to identify the suspect's location. The SO19 firearms officers involved in the shooting were debriefed and drugs and alcohol tests were taken as a standard procedure. The officers were taken off duty pending an investigation into the shooting. The Brazilian government released a statement expressing its shock at the killing, saying that it looked forward "to receiving the necessary explanation from the British authorities on the circumstances which led to this tragedy." Foreign Minister Celso Amorim, who had already arranged to visit London, said he would seek a meeting with the UK's Foreign Secretary, Jack Straw. He later met ministers and had a telephone conversation with Straw. The shoot-to-kill" policy and called on police to make clear their reasons for shooting the man dead. The leaked IPCC documents indicated that Menezes was seated on the train carriage when the SO19 armed unit arrived. A shout of 'police' may have been made, but the suspect never really had an opportunity to respond before he was shot.  The leaked documents indicated that he was restrained by an undercover officer before being shot. CCTV footage made available to the press following the criminal prosecution of the police show him passing through the barrier normally using his pre-paid Oyster card. Charles de Menezes is eulogised in the song "Loaded Gun", written and recorded by popular Australian punk band Chris Wood.
