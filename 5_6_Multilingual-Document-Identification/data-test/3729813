McEnroe took the tennis world by storm as an 18-year-old in 1977, when he made it through the qualifying tournament into the main draw at Wimbledon, where he lost in four sets to open era. Shortly after, McEnroe entered NCAA singles and team titles in 1978. After that, he joined the professional tour. McEnroe exacted revenge two months later, beating Borg in the five-set final of the 1980 US Open. Controversy dogged McEnroe when he returned to 윔블던 in 1981. Following his second-round match against Ted James "the pits of the world" and then swore at tournament referee Fred Hoyles. He also made famous the phrase "you cannot be serious", which years later would become the title of McEnroe's autobiography, by shouting it after several umpires' calls during his matches. This behavior was in sharp contrast to that of Borg, who was painted by the tabloid press as an unflappable "ice man." Nevertheless, in matches played between the two, McEnroe never lost his temper. Borg and McEnroe had their final confrontation in the final of the 그랜드 슬램 event. In 1983, McEnroe reached his fourth consecutive Wimbledon final and swept aside the unheralded New Zealander Chris Lewis in straight-sets. He also played at the 호주 오픈 for the first time, making it to the semifinals before being defeated in four sets by 매츠 빌랜더. At the 1984 프랑스 오픈, McEnroe lost a close final match to 이반 렌들.  McEnroe was on the verge of beating Lendl after winning the first two sets. But Lendl's decision to use more topspin lobs and cross-court backhand passing shots, as well as fatigue and temperamental outbursts got the better of McEnroe, allowing Lendl to win a dramatic five-setter. The loss ended a 39-match winning streak and was the closest McEnroe ever came to winning the French Open. In the 1984 Wimbledon final, McEnroe played a virtually flawless match to defeat Connors in just 80 minutes, 6–1, 6–1, 6–2.  That was McEnroe's third and final Wimbledon singles title. McEnroe won his fourth US 오픈 title in 1984 by defeating Lendl in straight sets in the final. 1984 was arguably McEnroe's best year on the tennis tour, as he compiled an 82-3 record and won a career-high 13 singles tournaments, including Wimbledon and the US Open.  He also was on the U.S.' winning World Team Cup and runner-up Davis Cup teams.  The only male who has come close to matching McEnroe's 1984 win-loss record since then was Roger Federer in 2005.  Federer was 81-3 before losing his last match of the year to David Nalbandian. McEnroe's 1984 season did not end without controversy.  While playing and winning the tournament in Stockholm, McEnroe had an on-court outburst that became notorious in sports highlight reels.  After questioning a call made by the chair umpire, McEnroe demanded, "Answer my question, jerk!"  McEnroe then slammed his racquet into a juice cart beside the court. In 1985, McEnroe reached his last Grand Slam singles final at the US Open. This time, he was beaten in straight sets by Lendl. The word "Filthy" was actually first used as a positive to describe the incredible nature of McEnroe's one-handed backhand. According to the ranking system maintained by the Association of Tennis Professionals, McEnroe first became the top ranked singles player in March 1980.  He was the top ranked player on 14 separate occasions between 1980 and 1985 and finished the year ranked World No. 1 four straight years from 1981 through 1984. He spent a total of 170 weeks at the top of the rankings. An epic performance was McEnroe's 6-hour, 22-minute victory over 매츠 빌랜더 in the deciding rubber of the 3–2 quarterfinal win over Sweden in 1982, played in St. Louis, Missouri. McEnroe won the match, at the time the longest in Davis Cup history, 9–7, 6–2, 15-17, 3–6, 8–6. McEnroe nearly broke that record in a 6-hour, 20-minute loss to 보리스 베커 five years later.  Becker won their match, the second rubber in a 3–2 loss to West Germany in World Group Relegation play, 4–6, 15-13, 8-10, 6–2, 6–2. McEnroe also helped the U.S. win the World Team Cup in 1984 and 1985. Nevertheless McEnroe had multiple notable victories in the final years of his career. In 1989, McEnroe won a record fifth title at the 윔블던, he defeated Canadian Open, where he lost to Lendl.  He also won both of his singles rubbers in the quarterfinal Davis Cup tie with Sweden. Controversy was never far from McEnroe, however. In his fourth round match against Mikael Pernfors at the 1990 Australian Open, McEnroe was disqualified for swearing at the umpire, supervisor, and referee. He was warned by the umpire for intimidating a lineswoman and then docked a point for smashing a racket. McEnroe was apparently unaware that a new Code of Conduct, which had been introduced just before the tournament, meant that a third code violation would not lead to the deduction of a game but instead would result in immediate disqualification. So when McEnroe unleashed a volley of abuse at umpire Gerry Armstrong, he was defaulted. Later that year, McEnroe reached the semifinals of the US 오픈, losing to the eventual champion, 피트 샘프라스.  He also won the Davidoff Swiss Indoors in Basel, defeating Goran Ivanišević in a five-set final.  The last time McEnroe was ranked in the world top ten was on October 22, 1990, when he was ranked 9th. His end-of-year singles ranking was 13th. In 1992, McEnroe defeated third-ranked 윔블던, McEnroe reached the semifinals where he lost in straight sets to the eventual champion 안드레 애거시. McEnroe teamed with 미카엘 슈티히 to win his fifth Wimbledon men's doubles title in a record-length 5 hour 1 minute final, which the pair won 5–7, 7–6, 3–6, 7–6, 19-17. At the end of the year, he teamed with Sampras to win the doubles rubber in the Davis Cup final, where the U.S. defeated Switzerland 3–1. McEnroe retired from the professional tour at the end of 1992. He ended his singles career ranked 20th in the world. In July 2004, McEnroe began a The Chair quiz show in both the U.K. and the U.S., but this venture also was unsuccessful. In 2002, McEnroe played himself in 윔블던''. McEnroe is active in philanthropy and tennis development. He owns an art gallery in Manhattan. McEnroe plays on two senior tours, the Merrill Lynch Tour of Champions and the Outback Champions Series. He is a TV commentator at major tournaments.  Many players and tennis experts agree that McEnroe's level of play is still high enough for him to compete on the professional level. In charity events and World Team Tennis, he has beaten many top players, including Mardy Fish and Mark Philippoussis. He defeated Andy Roddick in a doubles charity match, and was even able to volley back some of Roddick's powerful shots. In his second tournament, McEnroe and Björkman lost in the quarterfinals of the tournament in Stockholm. According to the ATP website, McEnroe had the edge in career matches on Cincinnati tournament.  Edberg won the last 5 matches with McEnroe, beginning with the 1989 tournament in Tokyo.
