This money was used to close in the quadrangle completely. With this the number of students increased to 290. In 1947, the year of Independence, the number reached 422, including ninety-three college students. Changes in the school department were dramatic. There was a steady increase in the numbers of day scholars. More striking was the growing international character of the school. An international student body was not new at North Point. There had always been a scattering of English, French and German boys, now students from China, Tibet, Bhutan, Nepal, Thailand and Burma started arriving. In 1954 twenty-eight nationalities could be found in the college, including the staff. Students from varying backgrounds and from many different parts of the sub-continent and beyond attend the school. The building of the structure was entrusted to Brother Eugene Rotsaert, who commenced with characteristic energy the levelling of the site, approximately 2,000,000 cubic feet of rock and soil had to be removed before building could begin, and a force of some two thousand men was employed for the purpose. Below the school site, the Maharaja of Burdwan had an extensive field known as Ladbrooke Farm. It was acquired on long lease and the property taken over at a moderate rental. Thus came to a close the year 1888. The work at North Point proceeded apace under the strenuous lead of Brother Rotsaert. Alignments were taken on May 2, 1889 and the foundations marked out. By May 10, 1889 the excavation of the foundations was completed and construction was started without delay. By December the plinth was four feet high, and in January, 1890 the arches were begun. On April 27 His Grace blessed the foundation stone. By December, 1890 the eastern wing had been roofed over. By June that year 1891, the whole building had been roofed over, and Brother Rotsaert now devoted his entire attention to the rapid completion of the interior. In December, to the surprise and delight of all, the building was declared fit to be occupied, and on December 8, Fr. Depelchin blessed the new school. It was during this year, 1892, that Mr. E. H. FitzGerald joined the staff. From then until his death in 1945 he remained with the school and contributed enormously to its success by his generous and whole-hearted devotion. Classes reopened on February 18, 1892, for the first time at North Point. The boys were delighted with their new surroundings and ever so proud of their school, already recognized as the premier school of Darjeeling. The House System was introduced in 1936. Four Houses Ashley, Garnet, Campion and Southwell had been established with a Boy Prefect each. There are no records of those after 1938. In 1952 the present system was introduced. The Houses were named after four deceased Jesuits who had served many years at North Point. Boys who come to North Point are assigned to a house. A great deal of pride is attached to activities relating to the House, be it games or other co-curricular activities. It helps develop espirit de corps
