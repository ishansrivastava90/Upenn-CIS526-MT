Shandiat ovat fiktiivinen heimokansa manga- ja animesarjassa One Piece. He ovat suuressa osassa Skypiea osan ajan. Heimo muistuttaa kovasti Amerikan alkuperäistä kansaa, intiaaneja. Vuosia myöhemmin "Knock-Up Stream" lennätti taivaalle suurimman osan saaresta, jättäen elottoman osan siniselle merelle. Taivaalla saari laskeutui valkovalkomerelle lävistyen jättiläis pavunvarteen. Taivaan asukkaat pitivät saarta pyhänä, kutsuen sitä Upper Yardiksi ja pakottivat Shandiat pakoon. Siitä lähtien taivassaaren asukkaat ja Shandiat ovat tapelleet siitä. Kun Luffylle, sota päättyi ja molemmat osapuolet aloittivat yhteisen elon Upper Yardissa. Molempia kansoja johtaa Gan Fall. Takauman aikana paljastui, että Shandioilla oli siivet selässään jo ennen taivaalle lentämistä. Nykyiset Shandiat palvovat yhä esi-isiään, mutta ovat hylänneet paljon uskomuksia vuosien aikana. Aisan mantra on uskomattoman voimakas hänen ikäänsä katsottuna. Kaukaa Shandian kylästä hän pystyi kuulemaan kahden "äänen" vaimentuneen, jotka olivat Satori ja Gan Fall. Lisäksi hän pystyi kertomaan kuinka monta ihmistä Enerin lentävässä arkissa oli maalta käsin. Aisa on erään lintulajin nimi.The related field of counterintelligence is tasked with impeding the intelligence efforts of others. These five phases are the absolute minimum to describe the process of intelligence, but, minimally, several other activities should be considered. Remember that the output of the intelligence cycle, if accepted, drives operations, which, in turn, produce new material to go into another iteration of the intelligence cycle.  Consumers should give the intelligence organization broad directions, and the highest level will set budgets. Any circular cycle is as weak as its weakest component. At one time or another, a national or failure in the cycle. Each of the four main categories has, in different countries and at different times, failed terribly. Policymakers have denied the services direction to work on critical matters. Intelligence services have failed to collect critical information. The services have analyzed data incorrectly. There have been failures to disseminate intelligence quickly enough, or to the right decisionmakers. There have been failures to protect the intelligence process itself from opposing intelligence services. Second, a newer usage of stovepiping is bypassing the regular analysis of raw intelligence, and sending only raw intelligence that supports a particular position to the highest national leadership. The highest policy levels of government set, in the broadest sense, intelligence priorities and policies. In some cases, heads of government give quite specific orders, but illegal ones. Others may be more on the level of "Do what you gotta do". Of course, in certain countries, the law is merely what the dictator decrees. Soviet spies in Warsaw. A Soviet agent first reported that Hitler planned to declare war on the Soviet Union in March 1941, and refined the estimate, by February 28, to May 20. Paul Pillar, National Intelligence Officer for the Middle East between 2000 and 2005, observed "Intelligence affects the nation's interests through its effect on policy. No matter how much the process of intelligence gathering itself is fixed, the changes will do no good if the role of intelligence in the policymaking process is not also addressed.... But a few steps, based on the recognition that the intelligence-policy relationship is indeed broken, could reduce the likelihood that such a breakdown will recur. Only those German reconnaissance aircraft that would pass over appropriately arranged decoys were allowed to complete their missions, and the Allies generated dummy signals corresponding to imaginary units whose organization and position was supportive of the overall deception plans. HUMINT, IMINT, and SIGINT were all collecting plausible data and returning it to the Germans. The Germans were unable to use collection techniques that revealed the real Allied plan. Due to limited resources, the US and South Koreans did not give a high priority to a potential attack, in 1950, by the North Koreans.  COMINT on North Korea was only an incidental by-product of monitoring the Chinese and Soviets. The main attack came as a surprise. There have been analytical failures, sometimes of imagination and sometimes of interpretation, since the beginning of modern intelligence. Prior to Pearl Harbor, US Navy intelligence did not adequately consider the British air strike against Italian capital ships in Taranto Harbor, but there was an assumption that torpedo nets were not needed at Pearl Harbor. It is not clear if the Pacific Fleet intelligence officers had clear reporting on Taranto, or if they considered it at all. At the time, there were organizational relations we would consider odd today, such as COMINT being in the Office of Naval Communications rather than the Office of Naval Intelligence. Weapons capabilities seemed restricted to the Bureau of Ordnance. Perhaps the most studied failure of a country to respond to a threat, because the operational commanders did not receive the warning circulating among analysts and policymakers, is the Pearl Harbor attack. It was clear that Japan was preparing to break diplomatic relations, often an immediate prelude to war. Only the last part of the diplomatic dispatch seemed a war warning. Even though US intelligence literally had the strategic warning in hand before the less skilled Japanese diplomats allowed to handle the dispatch, there were failures in transmitting the warnings to the field. This was due to a combination of factors, including Army-Navy rivalry, a less sophisticated communications system that did not confirm reception by the right commands, and reluctance to micromanage field commanders. Each intelligence source has different characteristics which can be used but which may also be limiting. IMINT, for instance, may depend on weather, satellite orbits or the ability of aircraft to elude ground defenses, and time for analysis. Other sources may take considerable time to collect the necessary information.  MASINT depends on having built a library of signatures of normal sensor readings, such that deviations stand out. In rare cases, intelligence is taken from such extremely sensitive sources that it cannot be used without exposing the methods or persons providing such intelligence.  One of the strengths of the British penetration of the German Enigma cryptosystem was that no information learned from it was ever used for operations, unless there was a plausible cover story that the Germans believed was the reason for Allied victories. If, for example, the movement of a ship was learned through Enigma COMINT, a reconnaissance aircraft was sent into the same area, and allowed to be seen by the Axis, so they thought the resulting sinking was due to IMINT. Experience in Bosnia and Kosovo demonstrated strain between CCIRM and US procedures, although the organizations learned by experience. Operation Joint Endeavor, began in 1995, with Operation Deliberate Force going to a much higher level of combat. Operation Allied Force, a more intense combat situation in Kosovo, began on 24 March 1999. Things worked better in Bosnia than Kosovo. "The majority of intelligence that the United States produced was tailored, timely, and releasable to IFOR. The U.S. intelligence community consistently disseminated actionable intelligence without divulging sensitive sources and methods."   The early phases were more typical of peace operations, and an efficient liaison system worked well.
