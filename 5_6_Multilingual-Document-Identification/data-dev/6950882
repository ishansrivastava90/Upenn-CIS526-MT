Yet here I make an exception, because the question seems so simple and the answer seems so inexplicably unnatainable. I thank you for your open and honest reply, Marco. And please don't be concerned about "crossing the line" between facts and opinion, the line is quite a bit fuzzier than most people would like to believe. With my legal background, I recognize that the interpretation of "what the law is", while dressed up as a "simple factual matter," is in reality an excercise in human interpretation, an excerise that, even with the most conscientious of interpreters, inevitably involves some "opinion". I hope you realize that I'm trying to be as NPOV as possible. I'm doing so because I don't want this to be an argument, even a friendly one, because arguments tend to get polarized, obscuring the possibilty of arriving at real solutions to real problems. What I want is as cold and logical an analysis as possible. As such, I'll try my best to refrain from as much "argument" as possible. Despite the above paragraph, I'll try as best as possible to stick to the "facts". Although the accusations concerning the targeting of civilians is rather disturbing, I don't think it would be appropriate, considering the non-argumentative nature of my question, for me to adress them. Here there's a lot of both theology and psychology involved. Actually, I think a lot of it has to do with what psychologists would term "projection". The Muslim world of today, according to their faith, would ideally like to see the entire world become Muslim. Put simply, Muslims go to heaven whereas infidels go to hell. The same goes for Christianity, at least in its classical sense. Either accept Jesus as your lord and saviour and thus go to live with him in heaven, or reject him and surely you'll go to hell. According to this logic, the world population should ideally convert to Christianity, if anything just to save their souls from eternal damnation. It appears, though, that there is a difference between the two, as Christianity seems to have evolved, to some degree, to question the legitimacy and rectitude of going around trying to convert the world to Christianity, whereas Islam has yet to experience this stage in its development. Unlike Christianity and Islam, according to Judaism, everybody ends up in heaven. Jew or non-Jew. It's actually a lot more complicated than that, but I'll leave it at that for now. Everyone knows that unlike Christianity and Islam, Judaism is a totally non-proselytizing religion. It's true, if you really, really, really, really want to become Jewish you can convert, but otherwised it's discouraged, and Jews certainly don't and have never gone about trying to convert the world. Why am I going into all of this? I return to the psychological concept of "projection". The Muslim world is convinced that Israel has expansionist ambitions, when it clearly doesn't. Why are they convinced of this? Projection. Since Muslims would like to see an exclusively Muslim world, they assume Jews would like to see an entirely Jewish world. The Muslim world is essentially "projecting" its own world view onto Jews. Ideally, modern day Israel would like to exist on the same territory as ancient Israel. It's true, this includes the West Bank, and that's why so many fundamentalist Jews are so eager to settle there. But Jews have no interest in Lebanon. Lebanon was never part of ancient Israel, and so Jews, even fundamentalist, would have no interest in settling there. Look at the Sinai peninsula. That too was never part of ancient Israel. That's why Menachem Begin, despite his extremely hawkish mentality, had no problem giving it back to Egypt in return for peace. Well, last time Israel occupied southern Lebanon, I don't recall any settlements being built there, and I don't even recall any Jews showing any interest in settling there at all. Correct me if I'm wrong, but your position seems to be an acceptance that Jews did indeed once have a nation in Palestine, that they were indeed unjustly expelled from that land, that they do indeed have a legitimate claim to that land, and that Israel is indeed a legitimate country. Your self described "anti-Zionist" stance would seem to be merely an issue of pragmatism and practicality. You seem to simply believe that it was a bad idea for Jews to assert what you seem to recognize as their legitimate right, only because the establishment of a Jewish State in the heart of the Muslim world could only spell trouble, and as such, would have a negative impact on world peace, and as well, would ultimately be a bad and perhaps even catastrophic move for the Jewish people themselves. Stu, since your view is largely based on pragmatism and does not appear in away way to be anti-Jewish, or even anti-Israel, I can't help but respect it. What you're basically saying is that both Arabs and Jews have a legitimate claim, which I actually agree with. However, as a pragmatist, I can't see how you can realistically envisage a "single, secular country welcoming all religions and ethnicities" as having any hope of survival in remaining as such. I think it was you who said earlier that invading Iraq and trying to turn it into a democracy was a stupid move on the part of the US because it just wasn't realistic. With the Sunnis, the Shi'a and the Kurds, all bitter enemies of each other, the inevitable result would be civil war, after which some dictator would end up on top, and we'd be pretty much back to the status quo ante. I apologize if it wasn't you who said this, but it would seem that this would be your view anyway. In any case, pragmatically speaking, if, as you suggest, such a secular state was founded instead of the State of Israel, do you honestly believe that it wouldn't ultimately decend into civil war as well? Do you honestly believe that the Palestinian people would respect the claim that the Jews have an equally legitimate right as they do? I've also mentioned before that the history of the oppression of the Jewish people is not a simple predictable one, but rather a cyclical one. The pattern repeats itself over and over and over again. It even goes back all the way to Egypt! One Pharaoh took a liking for us and welcomed us with open arms. His rebellious son, thinking his father a fool, took an especial dislike for us. But that's biblical, and I know of your views on the veracity of the Bible!संसार में सबसे पहले "व्याकरण" विद्या का जन्म कहां हुआ?
