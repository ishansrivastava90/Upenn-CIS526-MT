Исхраната во главно се состои од растенија, но исто така јаде и инсекти. Живее во номадски групи кои се содржат од 5 до 50 птици. Кога е во опасност, или се крие лежејки на земјата или побегнува. Ако е доведен во ќоше тој може да повреди и да убие со неговите силни нозе. Парењето се одвива на различен начин во различни региони, но територијалните мажјаци се борат за харем од 2 до 7 женки. Ноевите вообичаено тежат од 63 до 130 kg, некои примероци од мажјаци се најдени кои тежат и до 155 kg. Перјата на возрасен мажјак се воглавно црни, со бело на крајот од крилјата и опашот. Женките и младите мажјаци се сиво-кафеави и бели. Главата и вратот на двата пола се скоро голи, но има тенок слој на ситни пердуви. Се тврди дека ноевите произведуват најсилна комерцијално достапна кожа. Ноевото месо е слично со говедското месо, но е со ниска масност и низок холестерол, како и со висок калциум, протеин и железо. Сурово, е темно црвено или црешово црвена боја, малку потемно од говедското. Градот Oudtshoorn во Јужна Африка ја има најголемата популација на ноеви во светот. Фарми и специјализирани центри за одгледување се поставени околу градот како што е Safari Show Farm и Highgate Ostrich Show Farm. CP Nel Museum е музеј кој е специјализиран за историјата на ноевите. Ноевиот перјест бришач на прашина Оригиналниот перјест бришач на прашина е по потекло е дизајнирано во Јоханесбург, Јужна Африка од мисионер и менаџер на фабрика за метли Harry S. Beckner во 1903 година.Slovenya'dan sonra Hırvatistan Yugoslavya'nın yıkılışını izleyen dönemde en hızlı toparlanan ikinci ülke olmuştur ve bu nedenle AB'ye giren ikinci eski Yugoslav ülkesi olmayı hedeflemektedir. İstikrarlı bir piyasa ekonomisine sahiptir ve gayri safi yurtiçi hasıla gibi konularda 2007'de birliği katılan Bulgaristan ve Romanya'dan daha iyi istatistiksel göstergelere sahiptir. Hırvatistan'la müzakerelere başlamadan önce müktesebat normaldeki 31 sayısından dört fazla sayıda, 35 tane başlığa bölünmüştür ve daha önce tarımsal politika içine giren yeni başlıklar diğer adaylarda olduğu gibi Hırvatistan'da problem yaratacakmış gibi görünmektedir. Proponents also argue that Turkey abides by most conditions for accession. Some maintain that the EU can no longer refuse Turkey, as it has had an open candidacy for over 40 years, and has made major improvements in human rights in order to try to satisfy the entry conditions. Only a small fraction of Turkish territory lies in the common geographical definition of Europe. The country's largest city and its economic and cultural capital, Istanbul, lies partially in Europe. EU member Cyprus is actually located to the south of Anatolia and is  a part of Anatolia's continental shelf, thus geographically a part of Asia. The Commission presented Montenegro with a questionnaire to asses its application on 22 July 2009. On 9 December 2009, Montenegro delivered its answers to the EC questionnaire. The Commission's opinion will be submitted to the Council in the course of 2010. The successor states of the Macedonia, Montenegro, Serbia, and Slovenia), as well as Kosovo, have all adopted EU integration as an aim of foreign policy. Slovenia joined the EU on 1 May 2004. Croatia and Macedonia are recognised as the EU candidate countries and the former is currently in the process of negotiation. Albania in the Western Balkans was for a long period under one of the harshest authoritarian socialist governments in the world, which imposed on the people of Albania an international isolation similar to that of North Korea. The post-authoritarian Albanian governments have adopted EU integration as the strategic orientation of the country. The EU signed an agreement with Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Macedonia, and Montenegro on 13 April 2007, and Serbia on 15 May 2007, which included visa facilitations for the citizens of these countries. The signing EU Commissioner Franco Frattini was quoted saying that this is the first step towards full abolition of the visa requirements and the free movement of the Western Balkans citizens in EU. Citizens of Macedonia, Montenegro and Serbia will enjoy visa-free travel to the EU from December 19, 2009 on whereas citizens of Albania and Bosnia and Herzegovina have to wait at least until the first half of 2010. Negotiations on High Representative Miroslav Lajčák has stated that he will shift more of his focus for the time being from EU accession to reforms which would improve the standard of living in the country. The Union may show some leniency over economic requirements due to the political issues at stake. Former President of the European Commission Romano Prodi has stated that Bosnia has a chance of joining the EU soon after Croatia, but it is entirely dependent on the country's progress. The SAA was initialed on Tuesday, 4 December 2007 by Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn and caretaker Prime Minister Nikola Špirić. The initialing came in the wake of successful negotiations by Miroslav Lajčák in regards to passing his new quorum rules laws and also the commitment of Bosnian and Herzegovinian politicians to implementing police reform. The SAA was signed on 16 June 2008. As confirmed by the Thessaloniki Summit in June 2003, Kosovo is firmly anchored in the framework of the Stabilisation and Association Process, the EU policy which applies to the Western Balkans. On 20 April 2005 the European Commission adopted the Communication on Kosovo to the Council "A European Future for Kosovo" which reinforces the Commission’s commitment to Kosovo. Furthermore, on 20 January 2006, the Council adopted a European Partnership for Serbia and Montenegro including Kosovo as defined by UNSCR1244. The European Partnership is a means to materialise the European perspective of the Western Balkan countries within the framework of the stabilisation and association process. However, the EU members have warned that, following the significant impact of the fifth enlargement in 2004, a more individual approach will be adopted in the future, although the entry of pairs or small groups of countries will most probably coincide. Croatia may be expected to join first, possibly around 2012, and the rest of the Western Balkan countries around 2014. The timing of these enlargements is subject to many variables and the dates given in the table below are the estimated ones. Red-Green Coalition has blocked the issue since the 2005 parliamentary elections. Norway has applied four times for EEC and EU membership. In 1962 and 1967 1972 referendum and the 1994 referendum were both lost by the government. A large issue for Norway is its fishing resources, which are a significant part of the national economy and which would come under the Common Fisheries Policy if Norway were to accede to the EU. Norway has high GNP per capita, and would have to pay a high membership fee. The country has a limited amount of agriculture, and few underdeveloped areas, which means that Norway would receive little economic support from the EU. EEA agreement with the EU and signed the agreement on 2 May 1992 and submitted an application for accession to the EU on 20 May 1992. A Swiss referendum held on 6 December 1992 rejected EEA membership. As a consequence, the Swiss Government decided to suspend negotiations for EU accession until further notice, but its application remains open. The popular initiative entitled "Yes to Europe!", calling for the opening of immediate negotiations for EU membership, was rejected in a 4 March 2001 referendum.  The Swiss Federal Council, which is in favour of EU membership, had advised the population to vote against this referendum since the preconditions for the opening of negotiations had not been met. It is thought that the fear of a loss of neutrality and independence is the key issue against membership among eurosceptics. Switzerland has relatively little amount of land area with agriculture, to which a large part of the EU budget goes.
