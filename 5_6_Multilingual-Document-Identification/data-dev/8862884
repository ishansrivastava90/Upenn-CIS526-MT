উইকিপিডিয়ার নিবন্ধসমূহে উইকিপিডিয়ার বাইরের ওয়েবসাইটের লিঙ্কও দেওয়া যেতে পারে। কিন্তু সাধারণত তা নিবন্ধের মূল অংশে থাকে না। সেগুলোকে বিন্যাসের কিছু বিধিমালা রয়েছে। বর্হিসূত্র দেওয়া পৃষ্ঠাটিতে নিবন্ধের বিষয় সংশ্লিষ্ট গবেষণামূলক তথ্য থাকতে পারে। এছাড়াও নির্ভুল তথ্যও থাকতে পারে যা সবসময় কপিরাইট সংক্রান্ত কারণে নিবন্ধে সংযোজন করা যায় না। অন্য অর্থে যেসব তথ্য ঠিক নিবন্ধের বিষয়ের সাথে সরাসরি সম্পর্কযুক্ত নয়, বা নির্ভুলতা নিয়ে সন্দেহ থেকে যায়, সেগুলোও বহিঃসংযোগ হিসেবে যোগ করা হতে পারে। Wikipedia articles may include links to web pages outside Wikipedia, but they should not normally be used in the body of an article.  All external links must conform to certain formatting restrictions.  Some acceptable links include those that contain further research that is accurate and on-topic, information that could not be added to the article for reasons such as copyright or amount of detail, or other meaningful, relevant content that is not suitable for inclusion in an article for reasons unrelated to its accuracy. Each link should be considered on its merits, using the following guidelines. As the number of external links in an article grows longer, assessment should become stricter. When in doubt about the appropriateness of adding new links, make a suggestion on the article's talkpage and discuss with other editors. It is true that a link from Wikipedia to an external site may drive Web traffic to that site. But in line with Wikipedia policies, you should  avoid linking to a site that you own, maintain, or represent—even if WP guidelines seem to imply that it may otherwise be linked. When in doubt, you may go to the talk page and let another editor decide. This suggestion is in line with WP's conflict-of-interest guidelines. tinyurl.com, tiny.cc and the web proxies is prohibited for a similar reason. Instead, one should add a link to the original URL. It is generally preferred to link to the exact destination of a link. For instance, if example.com is an automatic redirect to tripod.com/example, it is better to link to the exact page, even if the webmaster considers the redirect address to be more official. More than one official link should be provided only when the additional links provide the reader with unique content and are not prominently linked from other official websites.  For example, if the main page of the official website for an author contains a link to the author's blog and Twitter feed, then it is not appropriate to provide links to all three.  Instead, provide only the main page of the official website in this situation.  In other situations, it may be appropriate to provide more than one link, such as when a business has one website for the corporate headquarters and another for consumer information.  Choose the minimum number of links that provide readers with the maximum amount of information. Links that provide consistent information are strongly preferred to social networking and communication services where the content changes rapidly and may not comply with this guideline at any given moment in time. Most external links should present different details than citations. For instance, a concise description of the contents and a clear indication of its source is more important than the actual title of the page, and access dates are not appropriate in the external links section. Because citation templates were not designed for use in the External links section, editors that use citation templates in this section should be careful to ensure the resulting description is appropriate for an external link. Templates may help organize a link maintenance project.  The  template is for providing notice that the list of links may have grown to an inappropriate length or contain inappropriate links.   is useful when the primary concern is the length of the list.   warns of suspected non-compliant links. If a page attracts many links or inappropriate links, a note in the external links section such as  may discourage the addition of links. In March 2010, each of these categories listed almost 2,000 articles that had been tagged for assistance with external links and spam.  Any editor can address these concerns by applying the advice on this page.  When an article complies with the relevant standards, then any editor may remove the tags. This guideline describes the most common reasons for including and excluding links.  However, the fact that a given link is not actually prohibited by this guideline does not automatically mean that it must or should be linked.  Every link provided must be justifiable in the opinion of the editors for an article.  Disputes about links can be addressed through the normal dispute-resolution process, particularly at the external links noticeboard.
