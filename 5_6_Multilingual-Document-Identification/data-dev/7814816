À l’époque romane, aux , l’Othon enrichit l’abbaye et de grands travaux sont entrepris. Aux  et , des gothiques sont construites au-dessus de la nef et des siège de citadelle par les Français, Saint-Pierre-aux-Nonnains devient un entrepôt militaire et le restera jusqu’au . La restauration du bâtiment débute dans les exposition.Nannasgade er en gade på Ydre Nørrebro og en del af Mimersgadekvarteret. Den starter ved Rådmandsgades Skole, og fortsætter ca. ½ km mod nordvest, langs Mimersgade, før gaden ender i Hamletsgade. Nannasgade er forholdsvis stille og præget af ældre beboelse i etagebyggeri, samt den nyåbnede BaNanna Park. Parken indbyder til både leg og fysisk aktivitet, idet den rummer en græsplæne med fodboldmål, basketkurve, bordtennisbord. Der er desuden etableret to store bananformede volde i ca. 1.5 meters højde, den ene etableres i græs og den anden i gul gummibelægning. Ud mod Nannasgade er der rejst en stor klatreportal, hvor blandt andet Nørrebros Klatreklub holder til. Holger Petersens Tekstilfabrik hedder i dag HP Coats, og ligger endnu på adressen Nannasgade 28. Dele af bygningskomplekset er blevet fredet, bl.a. den flotte borgagtige mur mod Hamletsgade.这种效果是传统摄影技术达不到的，因为摄影机不能以如此高的速度运动。也就是说只有虚拟的摄影机（通常用计算机模拟），在一个计算机生成的环境，例如虚拟现实或者电脑游戏中才可能“拍摄”出子弹时间的效果。在技术上历史上这种技术发展出不同的应用，例如时间分割（time slicing）、视角变换（view morphing）、超慢镜头（slow motion）、暂时死亡（temps mort）和虚拟摄影术（virtual cinematography）等。 在电影黑客帝国中，照相机的路径是基于预先用计算机设计的可视化模型。照相机摆在绿色或者蓝色的屏幕后，用激光瞄准系统按预先设计的轨道排放，在空间构成一个复杂的曲线。然后照相机的快门以非常接近的间隔被按下，这样动作可以在视角移动的情况下以极慢的速度继续展开。然后每一帧图像被扫描到计算机里进行处理。使用特别设计的软件，可以用加入额外的帧的办法更加降低动作速度并且改善动作的流畅性。也可以用删除帧的办法提高运动速度。这种方法比纯粹的摄影术提供了更大的灵活性。同样的效果可以用于生成纯粹的CGI，运动捕捉术和全息捕捉术。Anyone, whether directly involved or not, may add evidence to this page.

However, Jareth then posts allegations against all of the editors, and also argues that any punitive action should be equal. For explanation, Tina M. Barber argues that dogs bred by "splinter" breeders are not Shilohs.  The definition of the breed is the core of the dispute. I dispute the charges First accusation Third accusation I have no idea why this is even listed. It was my only post after days of attacks on the one picture I placed on the article page. Jareth had made multiple posts asking for the attacks to stop, they didn't and no action was taken. All I did here was defend the placement of my dog's picture after 11 attacks and 8 or 9 comments in defense by Jareth.Hardly an attack Attacks on me via the dog's picture I posted. Fourth accusation. Hardly an attack, it was in response to an attack, calmly stating that claims made are false Fifth accusation  Point was made after Tina M Baber was saying that the Shiloh was not a breed, just her own dogs. My point made was strong, but it was after attack after attack by Tina Barber and I did lose my cool a bit. Sixth accusation.  A response after weeks of attacks of every kind thrown at us by Tina Baber trying to discredit our dogs and our registries. She made accusations, I pointed out she was doing the same thing she accused us of. Seventh accusation  Editor was trying to revert the article back to what brought us here in the first place, and article that was bias and called our group immitators and dissidents. No attack, just a disagreement. If this is now an arbitration on the Shiloh article then Jareth shows a bias in only naming parties from one group other than Tina Barber. Editors from other group are not named yet are equally if not more guilty of same accusations. Trillhill  Breeder 24.242.252.125 aka Carmen
