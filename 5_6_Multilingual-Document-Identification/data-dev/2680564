Party line numbers were listed with a J, M, R, or W following the line number. The caller dialed the office code, the line number, and the digit corresponding to the letter. The panel system was designed to work with manual offices of up to 10,500 lines. Callers dialed the office code followed by the line number within the office. For lines 10,000 and up, callers therefore dialed the office code and a five-digit line number. Supervision or line signalling was supplied by a District Circuit, similar to the plug and light cord circuit that plugged into a line's TRS connector on a switchboard. It supervised the calling and called party and, when both had gone on-hook, released the ground on the sleeve lead, thus releasing all selectors, which returned down to their start position to make ready for further traffic. Some District Frames were equipped with the more complex supervisory and timing circuits required to generate coin collect and return signals and otherwise handle payphones. Many of the urban and commercial areas where Panel was first used had mostly Message Rate service rather than flat rate. For this reason the Line Finder had, besides the "tip and ring" leads for talking and the "sleeve" lead for control, a fourth wire for the District Circuit to send metering pulses to control the message register. The introduction of Direct Distance Dialing in the 1950s required the addition of Automatic Number Identification equipment to allow Centralized Automatic Message Accounting. When the selector had activated the correct brush or group, the sender sent a brief open circuit signal to command the selector to stop there and prepare for the next number for the next stage. District and Office parameters were variable translations supplied by the decoder, while Incoming parameters and Final Brush were a fixed translation from the Thousands and Hundreds digits of the phone number, merely to adapt efficiently to the capabilities of the Panel selector. In the 1930s when the 1XB switch crossbar switching system was introduced, it used the same Revertive Pulse Register signaling system, not only to control panel selectors but to signal within itself and with similar exchanges. Later 5XB switch, 1ESS switch and other systems included RP equipment in order to maintain compatibility, in some cases decades after the last Panel switch in the city had been scrapped. With RP, the pulses were going backwards to the sender, a complex and sophisticated piece of hardware. If a selector failed to advance, it stopped sending pulses to the sender. A timer in the sender detected the failure, returned a trouble tone to the caller, held the switch train out of service with a grounded sleeve lead so no other caller would use the faulty circuit, and sounded an alarm. Staff could then trace the stuck sender, and identify and repair the defect while the caller tried again and usually succeeded. For compatibility with manual offices, operator's desk at the terminating manual office. Another type of signaling, Call Annunciator, used speech recorded on strips of photographic film to announce the called number to the answering operator. PCI continued in use for tandem purposes, decades after its original purpose had disappeared. In the 1950s Auxiliary Senders were added, to allow storing more than eight digits, and sending by MF for Direct Distance Dialing. MF was also used by Crossbar and ESS exchanges. Calls from manual offices to panel offices required the "A board" or outgoing operator to request the number from the caller, connect to an idle trunk to the distant exchange and relay to the "B Board Manual Incoming Call" operator the desired number. The "B Board Manual Incoming Call" operator would then key in the desired number. The Panel machine would then setup the incoming and final frames to the called telephone number.
