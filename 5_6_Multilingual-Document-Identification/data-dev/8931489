The ST was primarily a competitor to the Apple Macintosh and the Commodore Amiga systems. This platform rivalry was often reflected by the owners and was most prominent in the games and video market, the ST was generally cheaper, had a slightly faster CPU, and had a high-resolution monochrome display mode, ideal for business and CAD. Thanks to its built-in MIDI ports it enjoyed success for running music-sequencer software and as a controller of musical instruments among amateurs and professionals alike, being used in concert by bands such as Tangerine Dream, Fatboy Slim and 1990s UK dance act 808 State. In some markets, particularly CAD and Desktop publishing work. The ST was later superseded by the Falcon computers. Atari 8-bit machines, tried to convince Atari management to invest big money into creating a new chipset and console/computer idea. When his idea was rejected, Miner left Atari to form a small think tank called Hi-Toro in 1982 and set about designing this new chipset. The company, which was later renamed Amiga Corporation, started selling various video game controllers and games while it developed its "Lorraine" computer system. As more executives and researchers left Commodore to join Tramiel's new company Tramiel from releasing his new computer. One of Tramiel's first acts after forming Atari Corp. was to fire most of Atari's remaining staff and cancel almost all ongoing projects in order to review their continued viability. It was during this time in late July/early August that Tramiel representatives discovered the original Amiga contract. In March 1987, the two companies settled the dispute out of court in a closed decision. Adding to this problem was the number of large cables needed to connect to the peripherals. This problem was addressed to some degree in the follow-on models which included a built-in floppy disk drive, though this addition resulted in the awkward placement of the mouse and joystick ports to a cramped niche underneath the keyboard. Because of its bi-directional design, the Centronics printer port could be used for joystick input, and several games made use of available adaptors that plugged into the printer socket, providing two additional 9-pin joystick ports. A custom API was a higher-level interface to TOS. Another program that had good success on the ST platform was MasterTracks Pro from Passport Designs, of Half Moon Bay, CA., that was first put out by Don Williams for the Macintosh.  When the ST died, a PC version continued that one could port MIDI to using the generic .MID format.  GVox bought out Passport, and continues the program for Windows and Encore''. In addition to the sound-sampling functionalities, the availability of software packages with MIDI support for music composition and efficient sound analysis contributed to make the Atari ST a forerunner of later computer-based all-in-one studios. Even novelty tools such as SEUCK were available. Notable individuals who developed games on the ST include Dungeon Master, was first developed and released on the ST, and was the best-selling software ever produced for the platform. Simulation games like Falcon and Flight Simulator II'' made use of the enhanced graphics found in the ST machines, as did many arcade ports. One game, LAN games which became popular in the early 90s'. Games simultaneously released on the Amiga that had identical graphics and sound were often accused by computer game magazines of simply being ST ports. There was a thriving output of public domain software libraries that advertised in magazines and on popular dial-up bulletin board systems. Remarkably, a modest core fanbase for the system, supporting a dwindling number of good quality print magazines, survived to the mid-'90s and the birth of the modern, publicly-accessible Internet as we know it. Despite the limited graphics, memory, and temporary hard-storage capabilities of the system, several email, FTP, telnet, IRC, and even full-blown graphical World Wide Web browser applications are available and usable on the ST. There was also an MS-DOS emulator released in the late 80s.  PC-Ditto came in two versions, software-only-, and a hardware version that plugged into the cartridge slot or kludged internally.  After running the PC-Ditto software, you had to insert an MS-DOS boot disk to load the system.  Both allowed you to run DOS programs in CGA mode, though much more slowly than on an IBM PC.
