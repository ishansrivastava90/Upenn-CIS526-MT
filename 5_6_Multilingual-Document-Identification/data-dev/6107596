The DeMeo crew was notorious for their ruthless violence. The crew was suspected to be involved in 75 to 200 murders throughout the mid 1970s and into the early 1980s, when the majority of the crew members still alive were brought to justice. Joseph "Joey" Testa and Anthony Senter became known as the "Gemini twins" because they were always together. It was said by associates who knew the friends well that Joseph would start a sentence and Anthony would finish it. Chris Rosenberg hired Senter and Testa to wax his Corvette and Porsche and steal cars for him. Rosenberg introduced his friends Senter and Testa to Roy DeMeo and then joined his crew. Senter and Testa were experienced car thiefs and full-blooded Italians. DeMeo, Rosenberg, Senter and Testa made up the core group of the DeMeo crew. Anthony was raised in a turbulent household and had a contemptuous view of the outside legitimate world's ways which he fostered when growing up. While Anthony quit high school before Joseph, for the most part whatever Joseph did, Anthony followed. Joseph, two months older and quicker on his feet than Anthony, was one of nine children born to a transport truck driver and a housewife. Growing up, mutual friends liked Anthony more than Joseph, but always ran to Joey when problems arose. When Joseph was fifteen, a thirteen year old neighbour was mugged by a knife wielding Puerto-Rican from East New York. The assaulted victim complained to Joseph, who rounded up Anthony, and a group led by Joseph borrowed someone's car and spent the day searching for the assailant. In 1973, when Joseph himself nearly died in a bar fight with a Puerto-Rican opponent after the blade punctured his lung, Anthony hunted the Puerto-Rican down and nearly beat him to death with his fists. Anthony stood at 5'11", two inches taller than Joey. Before following Joey into Rosenberg and DeMeo's world of organized crime, he worked at his father's small debris removal business and his uncle Robert's sanitation company. He only had one sibling, a sister. His parents divorced when he was eight, then remarried one another when he was fourteen. By then he was a full fledged criminal. Anthony was a nephew of notorious Colombo/Gambino crime family associate, Robert Senter who gained notoriety for the kidnapping and murder of Emanuel Gambino, the nephew of Gambino crime family boss Carlo Gambino and nephew of Paul Castellano. He is the paternal nephew of Robert Senter, a Colombo crime family capo who was indebted to Emanuel Gambino, the nephew of mob family patriarch Carlo Gambino for $21,000. Robert and an associate, an Irish-American named John Kilcullen gained notoriety as the individuals having actually orchestrated the kidnapping of Emanuel Gambino. On December 4, 1972, Robert Senter was arrested and confessed to the murder of Gambino. He also revealed the identities of Richard Chaisson and Warren Schurman who were his two accomplices. On June 1, 1973, Robert pleaded guilty to manslaughter and was sentenced to fifteen years in prison. After his release Robert was murdered by Colombo crime family associates from Brooklyn on orders from Colombo crime family capo John Matera. Senter was an accomplished car thief who was a large earner for the Gemini Lounge crew, but was highly disliked by Albert DeMeo, the son of Roy DeMeo. Albert's personal judgement of Senter was that, "there was something slick and phony about him". He had a collapsed lung from a near fatal knife fight and chain smoked. He was always to be seen pressing his hand against his chest and complaining that he couldn't breathe. When Senter joined the DeMeo crew, he gained a reputation as a sadistic killer who enjoyed mutilating his victims.  Senter also gained a reputation for providing the crew with significant revenue from auto theft. Senter's best friend in the DeMeo crew was mobster Joseph Testa. In 1994, it was discovered that pension dues were being paid into a Teamsters pension account in Senter's name by a cousin of Senter, one Dominic Vulpis, who owned a garbage company. A court investigator determined that $30,000 of dues had been paid into the account over a six-year period all the while Senter was in prison on a life sentence. Union officials said Senter could have qualified for a pension of $1,400 a month if the payments by Canarsie Recycling had continued for another five years.
