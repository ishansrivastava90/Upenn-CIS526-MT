Dr. Bryant’s landmark assessment of the problems and vast inequities in health care delivery in the world’s less economically favored nations. The book’s systematic approach, fair assessment, and stark conclusions stunned many of its readers and helped inspire an entire generation of students in public and international health. Following the completion of his study, the Rockefeller Foundation arranged for him to write up the results in Bangkok, Thailand, where he was appointed professor of medicine at the Ramathibodi Hospital Faculty of Medicine and where he simultaneously served as a consultant on medical education to the government of Thailand. In Thailand Dr. Bryant shifted his focus from clinical medicine to the business of teaching health to people at the community level and reaching populations that weren’t served. He helped establish a program in community medicine, in the process helping Thailand transform its medical education programs. Meanwhile, “Health & the Developing World” brought him to the attention of the Carnegie Foundation support, Dr. Bryant created the Center for Community Health Development to help foster a more fluid and effective interaction among the medical school, Presbyterian Hospital, the community, and smaller hospitals and health care centers in the community. With the goal of breaking through institutional barriers to reach out to the community, he developed interdisciplinary programs with Columbia’s business and social work schools. In 1978, Dr. Julius Richmond, U.S. Surgeon General under President Jimmy Carter, invited him to expand the activities of the Office of International Health and increase its effectiveness in linking the United States with international health activities. In 1978 Dr. Bryant served as a member of the U.S. delegation to the International Conference on Primary Health Care in Alma Ata, Kazakstan, then a part of the USSR. The first international gathering to recognize the need to reach out beyond existing hospital structures, Alma Ata affirmed that “no one would be left out.” Its very name became a catchword for the fundamental doctrine of “health for all.” As a member since 1982 and president since 1990 of the Council for International Organizations of Medical Sciences, he helped organize a number of international conferences on health policy, ethics and human values, and various aspects of the international pharmaceutical industry. This role has led to many cooperative efforts with the Islamic Organization for Medical Sciences, to which he remains a trusted adviser. Since the mid-1970s, he has served as a consultant to, and subsequently joined the board of, Hospital Albert Schweitzer Haiti. In 1998, Dr. Bryant engaged in co-organizing a WHO conference in Geneva on equity in health-care delivery. This work expanded into a series of workshops on the ethics of health-care delivery, sponsored by the Rockefeller Foundation, and workshops were held in Pakistan, Thailand, Mexico, and Colombia. He helped the government of Thailand cope with a serious “brain drain” of its physicians from rural to urban areas. He helped create and taught at the Tropical Institute for Community Health and Development for Africa in Kisumu, Kenya, and lent his guidance to students and faculty in the development there of community-based Orphan Care Support Systems. Among other projects, he is participated in an effort to develop the Pakistan-India Forum for Health and Well-Being as a binational health research collaboration in the interest of peace. Recipient in 2000 of the Life Time Achievement Award for Excellence in International Health of the American Public Health Association and in 2001 of an honorary doctorate of science degree from the University of Arizona. He is author or co-author of multiple books and monographs. He now lives in a retirement community in Charlottesville, Virginia. Each summer, he works in Kenya, teaching in Kisumu at the Tropical Institute for Community Health and Development. He is also working with UN Habitat, Nairobi, on the problems of Aids Orphans and Vulnerable Children in the Urban Slums of Africa.
