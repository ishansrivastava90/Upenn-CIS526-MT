स्वामी श्रद्धानन्द भारत के उन महान राष्ट्रभक्त संन्यासियों में अग्रणी थे, जिन्होंने अपना जीवन स्वाधीनता, स्वराज्य, शिक्षा तथा वैदिक धर्म के प्रचार-प्रसार के लिए समर्पित कर दिया था। पिता का ट्रान्सफर अलग-अलग स्थानों पर होने के कारण उनकी आरम्भिक शिक्षा अच्छी प्रकार नहीं हो सकी। लहौर और जालंधर उनके मुख्य कार्यस्थल रहे।  एक बार आर्य समाज के संस्थापक स्वामी दयानन्द सरस्वती वैदिक-धर्म के प्रचारार्थ बरेली पहुंचे। पुलिस अधिकारी नानकचन्द अपने पुत्र मुंशीराम को साथ लेकर स्वामी दयानन्द का प्रवचन सुनने पहुंचे। युवावस्था तक मुंशीराम ईश्वर के अस्तित्व में विश्वास नहीं करते थे। लेकिन स्वामी दयानन्द जी के तर्कों और आशीर्वाद ने मुंशीराम को दृढ़ ईश्वर विश्वासी तथा वैदिक धर्म का अनन्य भक्त बना दिया।There are also historical dimensions to the phenomenon, and the history of Western influence and control after the fall of the Ottoman Empire in 1918, is a common stated reason used within some terrorist groups to justify and explain its use of violence as resistive and retributive against western influences. __TOC__ Transnational Islamist ideology, specifically of the militant Islamists, assert that Western polities and society are actively anti-Islamic, or as it is sometimes described, waging a "war against Islam".  Islamists often identify what they see as a historical struggle between Christianity and Islam, dating back as far as the Crusades, among other historical conflicts between practitioners of the two respective religions.  Osama bin Laden, for example, almost invariably describes his enemy as aggressive and his call for action against them as defensive. Defensive jihad differs from offensive jihad in being "fard al-ayn," or a personal obligation of all Muslim, rather than "fard al-kifaya", a communal obligation, which if some Muslims perform it is not required from others. Hence, framing a fight as defensive has the advantage both of appearing to be a victim rather than aggressor, and of giving your struggle the very highest religious priority for all good Muslims. Many of the violent terrorist groups use the name of jihad to fight against Christians and Jews. An example is Bin Laden's Al-Qaeda, which is also known as 'International Islamic Front for Jihad Against the Jews and Crusaders'. Most militant Islamists oppose Israel's policies, and often its existence.
