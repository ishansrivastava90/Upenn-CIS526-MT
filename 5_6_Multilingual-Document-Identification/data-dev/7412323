In the history of cardboard or similar). The earliest known description is due to the polymath Girolamo Cardano in 1550. His proposal was for a rectangular stencil allowing single letters, syllables, or words to be written, then later read, through its various apertures. The written fragments of the plaintext could be further disguised by filling the gaps between the fragments with anodyne words or letters. This variant is also an example of steganography, as are many of the grille ciphers. The Cardan grille was invented as a method of secret writing. The word cryptography became the more familiar term for secret communications from the middle of the 17th century.  Earlier, the word steganography was common. The other general term for secret writing was cypher - also spelt cipher.  There is a modern distinction between cryptography and steganography It is difficult to fulfil all three conditions simultaneously.  Condition 3 applies to steganography.  Bacon meant that a cipher message should, in some cases, not appear to be a cipher at all. The original  Cardan Grille met that aim. Variations on the Cardano original, however, were not intended to fulfill condition 3 and generally failed to meet condition 2 as well. But, few  if any ciphers have ever achieved this second condition, so the point is generally a cryptanalyst’s delight whenever the grille ciphers are used. Removing the grille, the grid is filled with random letters and numbers.  Then, one hopes, only the possessor of the grille or a copy can read out the hidden letters or numbers – which could, for example, be the key to a polyalphabetic cipher such as that proposed around the same time by Giambattista della Porta. Cardano is not known to have proposed this variation, but he was a chess player who wrote a book on gaming, so the pattern would have been familiar to him.  Whereas the ordinary Cardan grille has arbitrary perforations, if his method of cutting holes is applied to the white squares of a chess board a regular pattern results. The encipherer begins with the board in the wrong position for chess.  Each successive letter of the message is written in a single square.  If the message is written vertically, it is taken off horizontally and vice versa.

Following the chess analogy, the route taken might be the knight’s move. Or some other path can be agreed upon, such as a reverse spiral, together with a specific number of nulls to pad the start and end of a message. Rectangular Cardan grilles can be placed in four positions.  The trellis or chessboard has only two positions, but it gave rise to a more sophisticated turning grille with four positions that can be rotated in two directions. Baron Edouard Fleissner von Wostrowitz, a retired Austrian cavalry colonel, described a variation on the chess board cipher in 1880 and his grilles were adopted by the German army during the World War I. These grilles are often named after Fleissner, although he took his material largely from a German work, published in Tübingen in 1809, written by Klüber who attributed this form of the grille to Cardano. Bauer notes that grilles were used in the 18th century, for example in 1745 in the administration of the Dutch Stadthouder William IV. Later, the mathematician C. F. Hindenburg studied turning grilles more systematically in 1796. '[they]are often called Fleissner grilles in ignorance of their historical origin.' The grille has four positions – North, East, South, West. Each position exposes 16 of the 64 squares.  The encipherer places the grille on a sheet and writes the first 16 letters of the message.  Then, turning the grille through 90 degrees, the second 16 are written, and so on until the grid is filled.Bert Hellinger a partire dal fenomenologica e sistemica. Poco dopo lo stesso periodo, in Francia Doris e Lise Langlois, mettono a punto un'altra tecnica ancora sorella delle costellazioni familiari, dandole il nome di "Psicogenealogia". La "costellazione" si svolge, di norma, ma non esclusivamente, nel corso di seminari di gruppo, dove uno o più partecipanti sono potenzialmente interessati a rappresentare la propria “costellazione familiare". I seminari riguardanti le "costellazioni sistemiche", cioè riguardanti gruppi o strutture sociali, come quelli del lavoro, di nazioni, di religioni, di società, si svolgono con una struttura simile. L’immagine creata secondo la teoria di Hellinger potrebbe far iniziare la trasformazione interiore della persona in questione, che potrebbe durare anche per un lungo periodo e coinvolgerebbe l'intelletto, la nostra parte consapevole, in maniera assai limitata. Una costellazione, in genere, può durare dai 20 minuti ad un’ora, ma vi possono essere costellazioni più brevi o più lunghe.  Scopo principale dell’agito non sarebbe quello di far chiarezza sulle migliaia di "ombreggiature" presenti in una famiglia, ma quello di portare in vista il cosiddetto "irretimento", che costituirebbe l'impasse saliente per la persona interessata.
