అంతే గాకుండా ఆ స్థలంలోనికి వాహనాలు వెళ్ళగలిగితే తాను మెషిన్ గన్లతో కాల్పులు జరిపించి ఉండేవాడినని, కాని ఇరుకైన సందులలోకి సాయుధ వాహనాలు వెళ్ళడం కుదరలేదని చెప్పాడు. జనం చెల్లా చెదురైనా గాని కాల్పులు ఆపలేదని, కొద్దిపాటి కాల్పులవల్ల ప్రయోజనం లేదని, జనం అంతా వెళ్ళిపోయేదాకా కాల్పులు జరపడం తన బాధ్యత అని చెప్పాడు. గాయపడినవారిని ఆసుపత్రులకు తరలించడం తన బాధ్యత కాదు గనుక అలాంటి ప్రయత్నమేమీ చేయలేదని, ఆసుపత్రులు తెరచి ఉన్నందున వారే వెళ్ళవచ్చునని కూడా అన్నాడు.Primii stăpâni ai castelului Chenonceau au fost familia de Cher. Din acest edificiu iniţial nu ne mai rămâne azi decât marele Bohier a reuşit să preia întreaga proprietate, a demolat vechile clădiri, cu excepţia unui Renaşterii franceze. Fiul său, Cher din banii proveniţi din impozitul pe clopote, şi a magnificelor grădini ce-i poartă numele apelând la serviciile arhitectului Philibert Delorme. În Caterina a preluat controlul, interzicând accesul Dianei de Poitiers în preajma bolnavului, în pofida repetatelor chemări ale acestuia. După moartea lui, Caterina a exilat fosta amantă a regelui, şi pentru prima oară a fost capabilă să exercite puterea conferită de statutul de regină.Aceasta s-a razbunat pe Diane de Poitiers, luandu-i castelul în schimbul celui de la Chaumont.Aceasta s-a retras la Anet, unde a murit în 1566. Înaintea morţii sale, în 1589, Caterina de Medici dăruieşte castelul Chenonceau nurorii sale Louise de Lorraine-Vandémont, soţia regelui Henri al III-lea care după asasinarea acestuia, s-a izolat aici, impunând o atmosferă sumbră, dominată de culorile alb-negru ale doliului.Istoria i-a păstrat numele de Regina Albă , pentru că a respectat până la moartea sa în 1601, doliul alb, regal.The Headmaster since 2005 is Tim Haynes, previously Headmaster of Monmouth School. Other Headmasters have included Michael McCrum, who served as Vice-Chancellor of the University of Cambridge, Master of Corpus Christi College, Cambridge, and Head Master of  Eton College, as well as Headmaster of Tonbridge. The current Head Master of Eton, Tony Little, was also a Housemaster at Tonbridge. The Good Schools Guide describes the school as "truly excellent". It is not one of the nine public schools mentioned in the Public Schools Act 1868, but it is just as old as, or older than, five of those which are. It is among the 25 boarding schools mentioned in the Public Schools Yearbook of 1889, and is one of the founding schools of the HMC. It is one of only a very few of the ancient public schools not to have turned co-educational, and there are no plans for this ever to take place. Sir Andrew, himself a distinguished member of this Company, left property in the St Pancras as an endowment for the school. The income from these estates is at the disposal of the Governors for the general benefit of the Foundation. The memory of Sir Andrew Judd and other benefactors is honoured in an annual Commemoration Service, held on Skinners' Day at the end of the Summer term. The school remembers its founder every year on Skinners' Day, and also remebers other benefactors, such as Sir Thomas Smythe, Judd's grandson, who was governor of the East India Company for fifteen years and who took part in establishing the colony of Virginia, who founded four exhibitions from Tonbridge to the universities of Oxford and Cambridge, as well as Henry Fisher, who founded a scholarship from Tonbridge to Brasenose College, Oxford, and Sir Thomas White, founder of St John's College, Oxford, who gave Tonbridge a fellowship, later converted into a scholarship, at his college, along with various other benefactors. The school first really began to flourish in the 19th century when it and other public schools supplied the demand for capable men to administer and soldier for the British Empire. It is recorded that alumni served in the Crimean War, the Indian Mutiny, the Boer War and even under the 8th Earl of Elgin during the Second Opium War. Indeed Headmaster Knox once noted that "wherever the Union Flag stands o'ershadowed, there you will find a Tonbridge boy ready to bring it into the light". In the Victorian Era, Headmaster Welldon introduced "Praeposters" in the Sixth formm, who were allowed to wear tall hats and tailcoats, to be absent from "Call" or detentions, and who were allowed to inflict corporal punishment on younger boys. The chapel, and the institution of "Fagging", grew in importance in this period as well. It was also at the time of the great expansion of public schools in the Victorian era that Tonbridge can truly be said to have become one of Britain's  Major Public Schools, having only been about three before the expansion, often defined by the list of schools that play Racquets. At the start of the Great War, 234 OTs held commissions in the active lists of the Army and Navy, with 124 in the reserve and territorial forces. The total number of Old Tonbridgians who eventually served was 2382, and 21 masters. The Roll of Honour includes the names of 215 OTs and 3 masters. Like many public schools, which provided the officer class of the British military, Tonbridge School lost a great many of its sons in those years. In 1925, Baron Ironside, an Old Tonbridgian, unveiled the School's war memorial, which was dedicated by the Bishop of Birmingham, who was also an Old Tonbridgian, which the whole school passes every day in the ante-chapel. Tonbridge itself had a more eventful second war. In 1939,Dulwich College was evacuated to Tonbridge, and enjoyed the use of Tonbridge classrooms and playing fields when they were not being used by Tonbridgians. Gas masks were carried by boys during all school periods. During the Battle of Britain, almost every night the siren would sound, and the boarders would hurry to their shelters and spend the nights there, until the all-clear signal at dawn, not an atmosphere particularly conducive to academic study. The headmaster allowed each housemaster to decide for himself whether to go to the shelters, or to keep the boys in bed and "damn the consequences", and eventually all the housemasters drifted toward the latter, as it was realised that the town of Tonbridge had little military importance and so any bombs dropped on Tonbridge would be dropped by accident. Little dmamage was done to the properties owned by the school in London. It was impossible to black out the chapel during services, so after an experiment of holding Sunday evening chapel in Big School during the Winter terms, it was decided to hold servcies in chapel and hold them progressively earlier as the hours of darkness increased, the earliest being 3.45 pm.سلام بر هم‌زبانان. سلام بر هم‌زبانان. البته درخیلی از ویکی‌ها این قبیل مقالات دستی تولید شده‌است. ولی شاید دلیل این کار این باشد که یا عقلشان نمی‌رسد و یا نابغه‌ای مثل لدزگروپ در اختیار ندارند.
