Links provide instant pathways to locations within and outside the project that are likely to increase our readers' understanding of the topic at hand. When writing or editing an article, it is important to consider not only what to put in the article itself, but what links should be included to help the reader find related information, as well as which other pages should carry links to the article. Care should be taken to avoid underlinking and overlinking, as described below. This page contains guidelines as to when links should and should not be used, and how to format them. Detailed information about the syntax used to create links can be found at disambiguation pages are set out in the disambiguation style guide. In each case the specific link is preferred. See also Section linking help. For example  links to Phrases. Legitimate red links should not be resolved by simply removing the bracket. If a red link is within the context of the article, and it is a topic with the potential to eventually be a neutral, verifiable and encyclopedic article, then the link should be kept. Such links do not have an expiration date, beyond which they must be "fixed". Red links should be removed only if they point to articles that are unlikely ever to be created, such as the names of book chapters, or if they would have little significance in the context of the present article even if they were created. By following naming conventions, an internal link will be much more likely to lead to an existing article. When there is not yet an article about the subject, a good link will make the creation of a correctly named article much easier for subsequent writers. Wikipedia is not a link collection and an article comprising only links is contrary to the "what Wikipedia is not" policy. The "printable version" of a page displays all URLs in full, including those given a title, so no information is lost. When placed in the References and External links sections, these links should be expanded with link text, and preferably a full citation, including the name of the article, the author, the journal or newspaper the article appeared in, the date it was published, and the date retrieved. If there is a dispute on the position of an embedded link, consider organizing alphabetically. If the language is one that most readers could not be expected to recognize, or is for some other reason unclear from the name of the publication or the book/article/page title, consider indicating what language the site is in.
