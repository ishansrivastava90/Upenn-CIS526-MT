At the ceremony, Trustee Carlos Carranco, Jr., of Laredo, himself a former LJC student, told the Laredo Morning Times that the institution  "from very humble beginnings has evolved to serve the needs of the community." Trevino was appointed to the LCC board by his future colleagues effective January 15, 1975, to fill the Position 4 seat vacated by Carlos H. Mata. He was then elected to five six-year terms, beginning on April 3, 1976. His last election was in May 2006, when he faced a stronger-than-usual opponent in former trustee Sabas Zapata, III, for a term of which Trevino completed less than one year. His last term would have extended until 2012. He was the board vice-president in 1986, 1990, and from 1992-1994. On the board, he was particularly known for his attention to details and was a constant advocate to keep down taxes and tuition. Trevino established his Southern Enterprises beverage company in 1957 and was heavily involved in business ventures in both the United States and Mexico. He had been a director of the Laredo National Bank since 1975. Trevino died of cancer. Services were held at St. Patrick's Catholic Cathedral in Laredo. He was interred in the Calvary Catholic Cemetery in Laredo. Monsignor Thomas A. Davis described his friend Trevino as a man of "deep faith", prayer, and courage. We always turned to Pepe for help. Most people will never know the good work he was doing because he did not seek notice or recognition." The Trevino Fitness Center on the South Campus of Laredo Community Center is named in Trevino's honor. Trevino was succeeded on the board by Edward C. Sherwood.
