Bud, furious upon realizing that Sissy had practiced without his consent and with his enemy, feels that his manhood is threatened and decides to upstage Sissy by riding the bull which is being operated by Wes, despite his back injury and being medicated. Bud and Sissy trade off riding the bull, the feud escalating ever higher until Bud is finally thrown from the bull. While Bud stumbles to his feet, Wes deliberately jars the bull joystick and knocks him down, breaking his arm. Bud and Sissy have a very heated argument at home. When Sissy tries to convince Bud that he's jealous because she can ride the bull better than him, he slaps her in the face and kicks her out of the trailer. Sissy seeks solace in Wes. A refinery explosion takes the life of Uncle Bob. During the funeral, Bud and Pam talk to Sissy who reveals Wes is also in the contest and plans to win as he is a "real cowboy". He plans to take the winnings with Sissy "deep into Mexico". In his grief, Bud decides not to participate in the bull riding contest. During the wake, Bud's Aunt Corrine, holding uncle Bob's winning belt buckle tells Bud that before Bud showed up, Bob had forgotten about his bull riding days, and she hands him the belt-buckle. She tells him Bob would have wanted Bud to use it. Bud's resolve to win is now set and his preparation is set to the song The Devil Went Down to Georgia. Finally, the day of the contest arrives, with Bud and Wes pitted against several other contestants for the $5,000 grand prize. Both Bud and Wes make it to the final round with three other contestants, with Bud eventually emerging victorious by one point.  Upset by his loss, Wes then grabs Sissy and return to their trailer, where he readies himself to escape to Mexico. He slaps Sissy after she initially refuses to pack. Meanwhile, Bud's girlfriend Pam urges him to reconcile with Sissy, since she realizes he trained and won to impress Sissy and not for her. Bud goes looking for Sissy and sees her in the parking lot, apologizes to her and they reconcile. After seeing that Sissy has been beaten, he goes looking for Wes to exact his retribution. Wes, having lost the bull riding competition, decides to steal the prize money and ties up some of Gilley's staff. On his way out, he runs into Bud and they fight. Bud punches Wes and all of the money that Wes stole falls out from his jacket. The Gilley's manager, discovering the attempted robbery, detains Wes at gunpoint. Bud and Sissy, despite offers of free beer, finally depart Gilley's together, the source and location of most of their troubles. The song that plays over the credits is Johnny Lee's "Lookin' for Love."
