Til tross all den negative responsen, solgte albumet til gull i USA, og nådde nummer 4 på listene og ga Dylan en annen nummer 1 hit på de Britiske listene før den falt ned fra listene. Motivene bak Self Portrait hadde vært emne for vill spekulasjon og stor debatt. Gjennom årene har flere teorier oppstått fra dem som har vært kjent med prosjektet. Kritiker Presley or The Everly Brothers, who veered toward the middle of the road, it wouldn't have shocked so many.» «At the time, I was in Woodstock, and I was getting a great degree of notoriety for doing nothing. Then I had that motorcycle accident [in 1966], which put me out of commission. Then, when I woke up and caught my senses, I realized that I was workin' for all these leeches. And I didn't wanna do that. Plus, I had a family, and I just wanted to see my kids. I'd also seen that I was representing all these things that I didn't know anything about. Like I was supposed to be on acid. It was all storm-the-embassy kind of stuff — Abbie Hoffman in the streets — and they sorta figured me as the kingpin of all that. I said, 'Wait a minute, I'm just a musician. So my songs are about this and that. So what?' But people need a leader. People need a leader more than a leader needs people, really. I mean, anybody can step up and be a leader, if he's got the people there that want one. I didn't want that, though. But then came the big news about Woodstock, about musicians goin' up there, and it was like a wave of insanity breakin' loose around the house day and night. You'd come in the house and find people there, people comin' through the woods, at all hours of the day and night, knockin' on your door. It was really dark and depressing. And there was no way to respond to all this, you know? It was as if they were suckin' your very blood out. I said, 'Now wait, these people can't be my fans. They just can't be.' And they kept comin'. We had to get out of there. This was just about the time of that Woodstock festival, which was the sum total of all this bullshit. And it seemed to have something to do with me, this Woodstock Nation, and everything it represented. So we couldn't breathe. I couldn't get any space for myself and my family, and there was no help, nowhere. I got very resentful about the whole thing, and we got outta there. We moved to New York. Lookin' back, it really was a stupid thing to do. But there was a house available on MacDougal Street, and I always remembered that as a nice place. So I just bought this house, sight unseen. But it wasn't the same when we got back. The Woodstock Nation had overtaken MacDougal Street also. There'd be crowds outside my house. And I said, 'Well, fuck it. I wish these people would just forget about me. I wanna do something they can't possibly like, they can't relate to. They'll see it, and they'll listen, and they'll say, 'Well, let's get on to the next person. He ain't sayin' it no more. He ain't given' us what we want,' you know? They'll go on to somebody else. But the whole idea backfired. Because the album went out there, and the people said, 'This ain't what we want,' and they got more resentful. And then I did this portrait for the cover. I mean, there was no title for that album. I knew somebody who had some paints and a square canvas, and I did the cover up in about five minutes. And I said, 'Well, I'm gonna call this album Self Portrait» Til hvorfor han valgte å gi ut ett ett dobbelalbum svarte Dylan, «Well, it wouldn't have held up as a single album — then it really would've been bad, you know. I mean, if you're gonna put a lot of crap on it, you might as well load it up!» «Self Portrait was a bunch of tracks that we'd done all the time I'd gone to bootleg records. So I just figured I'd put all this stuff together and put it out, my own bootleg record, so to speak. You know, if it actually had been a bootleg record, people probably would have sneaked around to buy it and played it for each other secretly. Also, I wasn't going to be anybody's puppet and I figured this record would put an end to that...I was just so fed up with all that who people thought I was nonsense.» Senere interjuer ble bare ett ekko av meningene han hadde uttrykt for Crowe. Self Portrait ble tungt kritisert for opptredene og hele produksjonen, mange av kritikere mente mange av låtene var dårlige valg av låter å covre. En av låtene klarte å trekke ros over årene, en låt skrevet av Appalachiske bønder som kjempet for å lage levebrød av landet sitt ville rutinemessig ta en liten prosent av kornen sin for å lage whiskey. Alt som ble produsert ble så gjemt vekk fra staten for å slippe å betale whiskey skatten i 1791. Appalachian zygote for rock attitudes, the hidden source of John Wesley Hardings shadows.» « Copper Kettle» ble popularisert av Joan Baez og dukket opp på hennes bestselgende LP fra 1962, Joan Baez in Concert. Blant de sangene han skrev selv på albumet, ble «Wigwam» senere kjent for å være med i Wes Anderson-filmen, The Royal Tenenbaums, fra 2001. Self-Portrait, som de fleste Dylan-album, har også et stort antall outtakes innspilt for albumet, men ikke brukt.  Flertallet av sangene er aldri blitt utgitt eller sirkulert blant fans. To bemerkelsesverdige sanger er, "Went to See the Gypsy" og "Time Passes Slowly", begge innspilt som potensielle låter for albumet, men tatt med på New Morning istedet. Self Portrait fikk mye negativ kritikk, men også litt positiv. På det beste, mente et par journalister, blant annet Robert Christgau, at det var et konsept bak Self Portrait som var verdt noe. I sin anmeldelse i Rolling Stone, advarte Greil Marcus at "unless [Dylan] returns to the market-place, with a sense of vocation and the ambition to keep up with his own gifts, the music of [the mid-sixties] will continue to dominate his records, whether he releases them or not."  Han sa også, "I once said I'd buy an album of Dylan breathing hard.  But I'd never said I'd buy an album of Dylan breathing softly."
