Situated next to the northern boundary of Cleveland County, Moore is the second largest city in the county and the ninth largest city in the state.

The city of Moore has been damaged by significant tornadoes on October 4, 1998, May 3, 1999, May 9, 2003, and May 10, 2010. The May 3, 1999 tornado that hit Moore was rated an F5 on the tornado in 1971. Moore was founded during the land-run of 1889. The early settlers came on train, horseback, wagons, and some, on foot. According to local historians, the town's original name was "Verbeck" as designated by the railroad company. However, a railroad employee named Al Moore, reported to be either a conductor or a brakeman, lived in a boxcar at the camp and had difficulty receiving his mail. He painted his name - "Moore" - on a board and nailed it on the boxcar. When a postmaster was appointed, he continued to call the settlement Moore. When the town incorporated in 1893 the name was legalized. The 1970 census showed an increase of more than 950% for a total of 18,761. The 1980 Census recorded 35,063 residents - an 86% growth rate.

On May 3, 1999, Moore experienced the most violent tornado ever recorded. As a result, over 1,000 dwelling units were destroyed and some 3,000 to 4,000 residents were either temporarily or permanently displaced. Several hundred homes have been rebuilt, and Moore is well on the way to recovery from that devastating storm. An important factor in the city's growth has been its location. The close proximity and easy access to the state's capital city on the north and the University of Oklahoma to the south make Moore an attractive, convenient place to live.
