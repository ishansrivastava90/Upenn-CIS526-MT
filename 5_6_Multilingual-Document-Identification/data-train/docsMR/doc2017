North Benwood North Benwood is the primary commercial area of the small city and contains a small, mostly empty shopping plaza, a grocery store, a gas station and several other small business and fast food restaurants. While all of Benwood lies in a flood zone, North Benwood tends to be hit hardest by the floods of the Ohio River. Center Benwood South Benwood South Benwood lies below Center Benwood and contains the majority of the city's industrial developments. Boggs Run Boggs Run has seen many devastating flash floods through the years, but one of the worst in recent history occurred August 31 - September 1, 1975.  Two other significant flash floods in the 20th Century occurred June 14, 1990 and September 17, 2004.  In the event of an Ohio River Flood, the mouth of Boggs Run is flooded both by the river and the creek, as the river flood backs up the flow of the creek. Outlying Areas While the areas of Benwood Hill and a portion of Boggs Run beyond Saint Matthew Lutheran Church are provided with some services from Benwood's public works, they fall outside the city limits and are not directly parts of the city. Public Schools There was a public school in Center Benwood.  It was first located in the Methodist church building on Main Street.  Later, the school was located in a structure built on Water Street.  The school closed in the early 1950s.  Both structures that once housed the school were later razed. A public school was located in North Benwood and closed in the early 1950s as well.  The Croatian Cultural Club building housed this school. Boggs Run Elementary School is located on Boggs Run Road beyond the Benwood city limits.  It was first housed in a wooden structure, but was later replaced with a brick structure on the same site about 1927.  The school closed in 1990 at the end of the 1989 - 1990 school year.  The brick school building still stands, and it now houses a Halloween museum. Private Schools The majority of the students who attended Saint James and Saint John Elementary School in Center Benwood and the former Saint Catherine Elementary School in North Benwood went on to attend high school at Bishop Donahue Memorial Catholic High School in McMechen, which was founded in 1955 and is still in operation. 1924 Benwood, West Virginia Coal Mine Disaster McMechen and Boggs Families
