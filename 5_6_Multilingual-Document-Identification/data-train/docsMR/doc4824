MMT was conceived as an idea of His Excellency President John Kufuor who spoke of the need of introducing a Mass Transit Bus system in the cities of Ghana at his inauguration speech on January 7, 2001. The government of Ghana's share is by means of the assets of the former OSA. In 2001, His Excellency the President directed the re-introduction of public mass transport in the metropolitan and municipal areas to ensure safe, affordable, efficient and reliable movement of commuters. Since then, the Government has been actively promoting public mass transportation. In deed, the benefit accruing to the nation from the introduction of a public mass transport system is immense. The use of public mass transport systems will therefore make our roads less congested, reduce air pollution and fuel consumption and ultimately, commuters will have a reliable and faster transport system. MMT at the moment has a fleet of buses made up of Yaxing, DAF, Neoplan VDL, VDL Jonckhere, VDL Dutch and Iveco buses. It is expected that the fleet will reach a thousand by the end of the year 2008. Total                    781         174                955 The Fiat-Iveco buses were donated by the Italian Government and helped a great deal during the pilot phase. These buses have played their part and are being phased out. All DAF & VDL buses have been financed through an ORET Grant agreement between the Dutch Government and Ghana. 35% of the value is a gift of the Dutch Government whilst 65% has been provided as a loan. All DAF Neoplaan & VDL Neoplan buses are manufactured at the Neoplan factory in Kumasi. MMT has carried almost 40 million passengers nationwide from January to October 2007over 12 million kilometres. MMT buses have carried 36,456,300 passengers nationwide and have given 3,724,644 school children free ride. Also, the opening of the Opera Square Terminal has opened the way for the construction of passenger waiting facilities at Accra- Bolgatanga. In general, MMT wants to set up a public transport system, an integrated network of scheduled buses. A public transport system interlinking residential areas, business districts, Central bus terminals, suburbs and villages in a reliable, efficient, safe and affordable way. The focus of MMT is presently on the short and medium distances, i.e. intra-city transport. MMT aims to co-operate closely with the Government to ensure that the pilot Bus Rapid Transit System succeeds. A Bus Rapid Transit System is the solution for heavily congested areas in the capitals of Ghana and that is why the current Bus Rapid Transit System of MMT will be copied to other relevant areas. Ghana can be one of the forerunners in Africa that combines bus infrastructure with a frequent bus service very effectively. Free bus lanes are a dream for every commuter but as well for the various police, ambulance and fire services. Job Creations MMT has grown to be one of the major employers in Ghana. MMTâ€™s current staff strength of around 2,474 is expected to exceed 3000 by the end of 2008 with the arrival of about 258 buses. Janitorial services, security, bus washing and cleaning are outsourced to third parties providing employment for additional 500 persons. On account of the construction of the buses in Kumasi, several indirect jobs have been created in the manufacturing sector. In general productivity of the workforce in Ghana would increase, since MMT can offer fast and reliable transport from home to the workplace. Moreover, the operations of MMT would empower the Ghanaian community by making job, shop, school and healthcare better accessible.
