But when Jerry Garcia died in the summer of 1995, many fans were left with a void in their lives.  One man who was determined to keep the fire burning was Ken Hays, who at the time ran Terrapin Tapes, a media distribution outlet for live concert tapers and traders. In 1996, Hays threw a memorial party for Garcia at Croton Point Park, NY and was re-named "Gathering of the Vibes."
