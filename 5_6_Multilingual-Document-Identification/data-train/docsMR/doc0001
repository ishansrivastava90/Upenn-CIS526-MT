Batley Bulldogs are a British professional  rugby league football club, from Batley in West Yorkshire. They currently play in the Co-operative Championship. Batley is also one of the original twenty-two rugby football clubs that formed the Northern Rugby Football Union in 1895, making them one of the world's first rugby league clubs. The local cricket club was to invite the winner of a game between Batley Mountaineers and Batley Athletic to join them at their Mount Pleasant ground. Both sides claimed victory but the cricket club chose the Athletic to join them and formed 'Batley Cricket and Athletic Football Club' in 1880. Their first game was against Bradford Zingari. They won the Yorkshire Challenge Cup five years later. Batley was one of the original twenty-two clubs that met at the Northern Rugby Union. Sixth in the Yorkshire Senior Competition of 1896/97, they battled their way to third spot come the end of the next season. Where knock-out competitions was concerned, they were peerless. In 1897, the 'Gallant Youths' became the first winners of the St Helens 10-3, in front of a crowd of 13,492 at Headingley. Batley retained the trophy by beating Bradford Northern on the corresponding weekend the following year. They won it again in 1900/01. Wharton 'Wattie' Davies set club records for most appearance, goals and points between 1907-1912. Batley won the Yorkshire Cup in 1912/13, were Yorkshire League winners in 1898/99 and 1923/24 and were crowned champions for the only time that same season. The record attendance was set at 23,989 for the visit of Leeds for a third round Challenge Cup match on 14 March, 1925. The club celebrated its centenary in 1981 with a win over the league's new London team, Fulham. left Batley added 'Bulldogs' to their name for the 1995/96 season. Prior to this the club's nickname had been The Gallant Youths. The newly named Batley Bulldogs finished 1996 at the foot of Division One. Batley won the Trans-Pennine Trophy in 1998. In 2003, Barry Eaton broke the world record for consecutive goals kicks. After a tough season in 2005 Batley were into National League One relegation play-offs, facing bitter rivals and neighbours Dewsbury. Victory in the final saw Batley stay up against increasingly well funded sides with Super League ambitions. 2006 saw Batley start the campaign with little promise after a series of dismal performances in the Leigh to end the Lancastrians' own hopes of promotion and ultimately earn Thornton the honour of National League coach of the year. Batley failed to replicate this success in the next round, crashing to a 30-0 defeat at Whitehaven to put an abrupt end to their season. After the previous season's mid-table finish 2009 started as a bad season for Batley. Halifax. Barrow 44-18, Whitehaven 48-22, Halifax 32-28, Widnes 34-30 and a last day victory over Featherstone Rovers 30-24, in which Batley were 14-0 down at one stage. With Karl Harrison having remained as coach, 2010 has started for Batley with 5 wins and 1 draw in the Northern Rail Cup, including a record breaking 100-4 win over Gateshead Thunder. Batley had a good run of wins in the Challenge Cup however they were defeated 74-12 by Catalans Dragons in the Quarter Final. Batley's current Co-operative Championship season has commenced well with wins over Keighley Cougars 22-12, Dewsbury Rams 22-8, Whitehaven RLFC 54-6 and Widnes Vikings 35-16 to see the club sitting in 7th position as of 23rd May 2010. Having finished top of their Northern Rail group section, the club entered the knock out stages. A tremendous performance away at Leigh Centurions in the semi final, where Batley were clear underdogs, put them into the final on 18th July 2010, where they face Widnes Vikings, in what promises to be a free scoring entertaining match. Whilst Widnes have enjoyed some success in recent history, it is Batleys first major final since 1952. Being a relatively smaal club, this is a superb achievement for not only Harrsion and his players, but lifetime fan and Chairman Kevin Nicholas and fellow directors and staff, who have transformed the club over recent years.
