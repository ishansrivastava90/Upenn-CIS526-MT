The ''' Chicago Cubs 4 games to 2.  The season was their 35th since they entered the American League in 1901.  It was the first World Series championship for the Tigers. In the outfield, Hall of Famer Goose Goslin played in left field.  Pete Fox played in right field.  And the speedy Jo-Jo White and Gee Walker shared responsibility for center field, with White playing in 98 games. Goose Goslin had a good year with 109 RBIs, 172 hits, and 34 doubles. After leading the Senators to American League pennants in 1924, 1925, and 1933, owner Clark Griffith traded Goslin to Detroit before the 1934 season.  Griffith told Goose he simply couldn't afford to pay his salary.  With stars Goslin, Gehringer and Greenberg, the 1934 and 1934 Tigers became known as the “G-Men.”  Goslin was the hero of the 1935 World Series, as he drove in the winning run in Games 6.  With the game tied 3-3, Goslin came to bat in the bottom of the 9th inning with two outs and Mickey Cochrane on 2nd base.  Goslin hit a walk-off single to right, scoring Cochrane, as the Tigers won the Series. The Tigers fourth outfielder, Gee Walker played 45 games in center field but also covered 29 games in left and 11 games in right. Known as "The Madman from Mississippi," Walker was a fiery competitor and a clown.  He hit over .300 for the 1935 Tigers, but his reputation for being inattentive and overzealous on the basepaths drew the ire of manager Mickey Cochrane. During the 1934 World Series, he was picked off first while arguing with the Cardinals' bench.  On another occasion, he tried to steal a base while the batter was being given an intentional walk. The pitching staff was led by starters, Tommy Bridges, Schoolboy Rowe, Alvin Crowder, and Elden Auker. After making a big splash in 1934 with an American League record 16 consecutive wins, Schoolboy Rowe had another big year in 1935. Schoolboy had become a fan favorite not only for his pitching performance in 1934 but for his nationally publicized romance.  While appearing on the Eddie Cantor radio show, Rowe famously asked his fiancee, "How'm I doing, Edna honey?"  The line endeared Schoolboy to the nation, and also resulted in relentless teasing from opposing players and fans.  Schoolboy and Edna married after the 1934 season and had their first child during the 1935 season.  Schoolboy led the league in 1935 with six shutouts and finished the season with a 19-13 record in 34 starts.  Despite a 2.51 ERA in the 1935 World Series, Rowe had a 1-2 record.  He was the losing pitcher in Game 1, despite striking out 8 batters, pitching a complete game and allowing only 2 earned runs.  In Game 3, Rowe got the win, pitching 4 innings in relief.  But Game 5 was another tough loss, as Schoolboy threw a complete game and allowed 2 earned runs, but the Tigers scored only once. The season started out poorly.  Schoolboy Rowe lost on Opening Day, and the Tigers were 2-9 after two weeks of play.  At the end of April, the Tigers were in last place.  By the end of May, the Tigers had started to turn things around but still had a mediocre 20-18 record. The team remained hot through Labor Day, having a record of 85-44 on September 7, 1935.  But the Tigers' bats went cold for the last three weeks of the season, as the team went 8-14 to end the season.  Despite having a ten-game lead over the Yankees on September 8, 1935, the Tigers let the Yankees back into the race, eventually winning by three games. On September 21, 1935, the Tigers clinched the St. Louis Browns.  Tommy Bridges won the opener, 6-2, and Elden Auker pitched a complete game shutout to win the second game, 2-0. After clinching the pennant, the Tigers finished the season by losing 6 of their last 7 games. Detroit's final regular season record was 93-58, placing them three games ahead of the second place New York Yankees.  For the season, the 1935 Tigers outscored their opponents 919 to 665. The '''1935 1907, 1908, 1909, and 1934. The Cubs had the better regular season record and had a 21-game win streak during the pennant stretch.  The Tigers, on the other hand, went 8-14 in their last 22 games.  Based on momentum, it appeared the Cubs would roll past the Tigers. The Cubs won Game 1, 3-0, on 4-hit shutout by pitcher Lon Warneke.  Schoolboy Rowe took the loss. The Tigers evened the Series in Game 2, with an 8-3 win, but the Tigers lost Hank Greenberg who fractured his left wrist when colliding with Cubs catcher Gabby Hartnett.  Greenberg had tried to score from first on a single.  He finished the game, but he developed severe pain on the train ride to Chicago that night, and x-rays revealed fractures of two bones in his wrist.  Greenberg was sidelined for the rest of the Series, and Mickey Cochrane was left to decide who could replace Greenberg.  Initially, Cochrane decided to play first base himself and have backup catcher Ray Hayworth take over at catcher.  But Tigers owner Frank Navin ordered Cochrane to move third baseman Marv Owen to first base and play utility infielder Flea Clifton at third base.  Cochrane disagreed, as Clifton was the weakest hitter on the team, and Owen was in a slump.  Navin insisted, and Owen went one for twenty in the Series, while Flea went 0-for-16 in the Series. In Game 4, Alvin Crowder pitched a 2-1 complete game victory.  The Tigers won on an unearned run in the 6th inning. In Game 5, Cubs' pitcher Lon Warneke kept the Cubs alive with 6 innings of shutout ball for his 2nd win.  The Cubs won 3-1 on a 2-run home run by Chuck Klein off losing pitcher Schoolboy Rowe. Delirious Detroit fans rushed onto Navin Field in celebration after Goslin's game-winning hit.  The celebration spilled out onto Michigan Avenue and Trumbull.  People from throughout Detroit flooded the central city in a celebration that newspapers reported went on until three in the morning.  For a few hours, the worries of the Great Depression were gone and the only thing that mattered was the Tigers. Baseball was hugely popular in Detroit during the Great Depression, as attendance at Navin Field in 1934 and 1935, accounted for nearly 25 percent of baseball's total paid attendance.
