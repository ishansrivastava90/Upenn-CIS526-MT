Ray had his childhood education at various places, and experience which brought into his art a rare variety of symbolism, folk traditions, and metaphor. Ray is however best known for his Pseudorealistic works, which have been exhibited at many major galleries and have been appreciated in India and abroad with great enthusiasm. Pseudorealism of Ray involves the playing of offbeat colours in unrealistic fashion and thereby creating a comprehendible realistic imagery. In Despair, Soliloqui, the tryptichs are some of the best known works of Ray. They have fetched good prices in the recently held shows.

Virtual Patients Progression of Obscenity Law''' The Hicklin Rule was utilized up until the 1930s, when it was eventually abandoned for the “work as a whole” test.  Two major court cases during the 1930s led to this final decision.  The first of these cases involved Mary Ware Dennet, a birth control activist, and her booklet on sex education.  The case against Dennet was thrown out after the agreement that sex education is acceptable when presented in a decent way. The second case involved James Joyce’s book Ulysses, which led to an obscenity case after it was forbidden to pass through the U.S. Customs.  It was decided that—as a whole—Joyce’s book was not obscene.  Because of this ruling, courts began to focus on the entire work when judging obscenity rather than isolated passages. In 1957, the Roth v. United States case answered the question about First Amendment protection of obscenity.  Justice William Brennan claimed that sexual materials that are considered prurient and are not socially important are not protected under the First Amendment and are, therefore, open to censorship.  However, the vague wording about social importance led to confusion in future obscenity court cases.

Det første danske møde blev holdt 16. oktober 1988. Der er ca. 700 grupper i hele verden, heraf ca. 500 i USA og ca. 40 i Danmark. Hver ACA-gruppe er selvstyrende i egne anliggender. Inden for den enkelte gruppe vil forskellige betroede hverv såsom mødeleder, kasserer, litteraturansvarlig og lignende oftest gå på skift blandt gruppens medlemmer.

Per i primi 5 anni del secondo dopoguerra  la Gran Bretagna  non dedicò attenzione allo sviluppo dei missili SAM, nonostante che essi fossero non soltanto molto promettenti ma venissero sviluppati, sulla base tecnica e/o sui concetti teorici delle armi tedesche ideate nel periodo bellico, in diversi Paesi del mondo. Non si trattava infatti solo delle grandi potenze, ma anche di nazioni come la Svizzera e la Francia, all'epoca ancora  devastata dalla guerra. Nondimeno, la Gran Bretagna aveva una tale forza di artiglieria contraerea, perfezionata per tutta la guerra fino alla campagna contro le V-1, che  l'esigenza di passare ai missili non era  considerata prioritaria. Dopotutto, le quasi 2000 V-1 abbattute sono rimaste il maggior successo ottenuto contro 'jets' della storia. Ma la generazione di aerei e missili che già si profilava sarebbe stata molto più prestante di queste primordiali armi. Dopo la Guerra di Corea l'esigenza ebbe un rapido cambiamento di priorità, tanto che durante gli anni  '50  si arrivò, particolarmente da l 1957, a ipotizzare la  sostituzione  degli aerei da intercettazione  con i missili, cosa che in un contrappasso dantesco giunse a portare alla cancellazione di importanti programmi aeronautici inglesi, che hanno costituito un danno permanente per l'industria inglese. Nel frattempo, l'industria inglese aveva  rapidamente sviluppato un terzetto di armi superficie-aria a lunga gittata, uno ritagliato per le esigenze specifiche di ciascuna Arma.  Questi missili erano molto potenti e relativemente compatti, con una struttura complessa e sofisticata, specie per i booster di lancio sistemati  attorno al corpo del missile.
