UK general election records is an annotated list of notable records from United Kingdom general elections. Prior to 1945, electoral competition in the United Kingdom exhibited features which make meaningful comparisons with modern results difficult. Since 1945, the evolution of a stable 3-party system has tended to negate each of the above features so that, broadly speaking, elections are more comparable. In Northern Ireland, as ever, the pattern of party competition is completely different from that on the mainland and comparisons remain problematic. Hence, unless otherwise stated records are based on results since the 1945 General Election, and earlier exceptional results are listed separately. For comparison purposes the following definitions have been adopted. These records detail the change in the share of the vote by parties when compared to the same constituency in the previous General Election. In some cases, such as Brent East in 2005 for the Liberal Democrats, the figures should be framed by the context of a by-election in that constituency between the two Elections. The most votes received by a single individual in a general election was Sir Cooper Rawson who polled 75205 votes when being reelected as MP for Brighton in 1931. However Brighton was a two-member constituency with a larger than average electorate. The largest majority received by an individual is also Sir Cooper Rawson, reelected with a majority of 62253 at Brighton in 1931. The largest majority received by a woman is 38823 by the Countess of Iveagh elected MP for Southend in 1931. Before 1983, the consecutive records were 6 candidates in 1918, 7 in Tottenham in February 1974 and 9 in Devon North in 1979. Birkenhead was the only seat contested by only three candidates at the 2010 general election. See Baby of the House of Commons Barnstaple.  He had sat for Gloucester from 1857-59.  John Potts was 74 when he returned to the house, after a four-year absence.  He had sat for Barnsley from 1922-31. George Edwards was 73 when he returned to the House of Commons, after a year's absence, as member for South Norfolk. He had sat for the same constituency 1920-22. Fermanagh and South Tyrone.

The longest continuous Labour government was in office for over 13 years, between 2 May 1997 and 11 May 2010. The longest continuous Liberal government was in office for over 9 years, between 5 December 1905 and 25 May 1915. The longest continuous coalition government was in office for almost 14 years, between 24 August 1931 and 26 July 1945, although its components changed significantly during that period. It is unusual for a party that had not contested the seat at the previous election to win it. Since the major mainland parties now routinely contest all seats, except the Speaker's, such rare victories tend to come from independents or splinter-parties. Records General Election
