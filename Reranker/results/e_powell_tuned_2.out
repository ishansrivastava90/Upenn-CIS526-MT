one of the causes of the secrecy was a lesson , who learned of the city .
in the operation tuesday was attended by members of the various police units , including the police force from districts - team , which are normally used for control of the criminal окрестными district .
" was to do it right then , when in the park is situated less than all the people " , " he said .
floodlights and pre - recorded announcements , несущиеся blared from loudspeakers , it seems , устрашили many parts of the protesters .
police said that tents not to be touched until 1:45 a.m. , giving the protesters time to collect things .
but many journalists argue that they did n't see how the police , and that police treated them rudely .
when police went to the west through a pile of personal belongings antifiltration protesters , including bags , plastic mats and bags , full of clothes , the health department followed the team , it was collecting what брошено .
the main group of protesters took positions near the camp 's kitchen , the center of the park .

union , representing hundreds of employees staff schools , who lost their seats in last month , plans to sue the city on wednesday , arguing that layoffs were not needed and were discriminatory because of the disproportionate influence on schools , where poor students attend .
six hundred and seventy - two school assistant coordinator , working with parents and other employees who were among the most low - wage workers in the city , have lost their place on october 7 , as a result of that union leaders called the political reaction to their refusal to give access to medical city funds , managed workers ' groups , to close a hole in the budget last spring .
at a hearing in the city council last month , the schools chancellor dennis m. уолкотт said that layoffs were part of the budget , which they signed in june .
representatives of the district council 37 reported that they have with the notice claims filed against him , the department of education , warning that ; on wednesday will be held a press conference to announce a formal filing suit in state supreme court in manhattan .
elizabeth thomas , a spokesman for the city 's legal department , said that the city have not seen the lawsuit , and therefore cannot comment on his specific provisions .
he points out that , while the статен - island was not layoffs , but schools in the upper east side or трибеки their was little , ancillary workers schools have lost 17 seats in the district 23 in браунсвилле , brooklyn , and 46 in the south bronx , was forced to resign in the districts 8 and 9 .
p.s. 36th 3,26 per cent was scrapped in budget this year , and it also lost money , when the city has changed the way of counting additional funding for each poor student , who is enrolled in school .

" meaning this resolution to commend the honors отважному people of libya , when they begin to rebuild their country , " said kerry .
language may seem harmless , but still no discussion on libya was not easy .
kerry and mccain have submitted a resolution in june , allows for the limited use of american armed forces in libya .
but in the same day , when bill failed in the house of representatives , the chamber also has not supported a proposal which would cut funding for american operations in libya .
resolution " admires the people of libya 's foreign affairs committee for his incredible bravery and formidable resistance in the quest for freedom " and thanked the men and women of the united states armed forces and their coalition partners , who participated in military operations to protect the libyan people for their unusual courage and professionalism . "

представитель люгера said on monday , that he not yet seen the latest version of the bill .
this measure , proposed a member of the u.s. house of representatives bob гудлатом ( a republican , virginia ) , will be the first constitutional amendment on the budget or about anything else , which will be on the plenary vote in congress this session .
поправка гудлата - just one of the 68 constitutional amendments , affecting a wide range of issues , which were made in this meeting .
there are at least 15 versions of the balanced budget amendments only in the house of representatives and much else about the " control over federal spending . "
the budget control act , which passed in august , demanded that the house of representatives , and the senate voted about a balanced budget amendment .
in addition to the budget , some congressmen want to limit the number of deadlines of members of congress , jose serrano ( democrat and member of the house of representatives , new york ) wants to cancel the restriction of the two term for president .
amendment banning same - sex marriages already offer for many years , and as another , effectively banning flag burning .
as neither aspired to members of congress to propose amendments , they are not faster , than in years past .
this rate pales in comparison with the beginning of the 1990s , when members of congress , according to the library of the senate , regularly offered more than 150 amendments every two years .
the latest amendment , which was adopted , the 27 - i - was approved by parliament in 1992 , but in congress she actually was in 1789 .

on the video , decommissioned kelly in the first few weeks , she lies on a hospital bed with a shaved head and a long scar on forehead .
a few months later , we see how giffords sits in the stroller , and physiotherapists teach her how to perform simple actions .

some people will look at them with admiration , because they smash the insurgents and were in exotic locations .
while looking for work , he says , he felt that some interviewers cautiously asked whether he will be able to withstand the strain responsible for work in washington immediately after the military campaign .

about 30 survivors and victims ' relatives attended the hearing .
" it was uncomfortable , but personally , i became a little easier , after i saw and heard the suspect . "
despite breivik 's strange idea about what he is part of a large movement " resistance " , the judge ruled that he 's not a mad , and said that there was no evidence that he acted with accomplices .
but this does not diminish automatically grief and confusion , which now feels the whole nation .

nothing new : two judges visit activities society федералистов for many years already .
in fact , the judges are free from the code of conduct , which regulates the actions of the lower federal judges .
nevertheless , the apparent closeness scalia and thomas to two legal firms in this case , as well as to companies with big financial interests , was sufficient signal for activists of ethics in government .
" judges wined and dined on official shares fundraising with lawyers , which now covers in court . "

" asia can be protected to some extent , but it cannot be invulnerable . "
the european monetary union was severely undermined by the european debt crisis in recent months .
unfolding in europe 's debt crisis has spawned fears that he can lead the global economy into recession again , and led to calls for the leading emerging economies gather together to help the eurozone find a solution . "
anand sharma , india 's trade minister , said that " india will do everything that can " to help the eurozone , as its own economy is now declining exports and reducing foreign capital inflows .
" we have a grandiose objectives , and we must maintain a high level of growth . "
others argue that there is no sense for emerging economies like india to help wealthy europeans , when they are faced with their own deep economic problems .

defense secretary leon panetta tempers in congress on monday , warning that expected automatic budget cuts will undermine national security and bring the financial chain reaction from pentagon corridors to the fields battlefield in afghanistan on the line and to the civil assembly .
" the consequences of these cuts will be devastating for the state department , " panetta said in a letter to senators республиканцу республиканке john mccain , arizona and lindsey graham , south carolina .
" such a strong reduction , so , make most of our projects кораблестроению repressions and construction unfulfilled -- you ca n't buy a three - quarters of the ship or buildings -- and do serious damage other modernization efforts , " panetta wrote senators .
" these changes undermine trust , who supports our army and will seriously damage боеготовности . "
" although foreign military financing in emergency operations does not directly affected секвестром , military achievements be severely affected by serious breakdown in the main budgets , " warned panetta .
" staff will be reduced , that will lead to опозданиям staffer with payments military suppliers , and legal and political support will be broken . "
" the consequence of sequestration in the department of defense will be the fastest decline of the united states as the world 's leading military powers . "
" this is not an option , with which we live in , and this is not an option , which we need to impose ourselves . "
whether panetta letter or recent warnings from senators will lead to budget compromise or inflame calls for release of the pentagon from reductions , we 'll see later .
at a press conference last week , defense minister painted a gloomy picture of what may be followed by further -- troops with shell , but without the putter .
" it 's a paper tiger , the army , with barracks , buildings and bombs without enough trained soldiers able to accomplish the mission , " panetta said , in their introductory remarks in the pentagon .
and panetta said that some of the biggest defense projects may encounter obstacles , including those which passed the tests , and some only on the early planning stages .
stopping further development and testing the f 35 can save $ 80 billion over 10 years , but his supporters say , that is a vital next step , to improve and to counter potential threats from china and other opponents .
a cursory glance at recent headlines , shows just how serious and повсеместны deception and lies in everyday life .
administration at the university of pennsylvania was charged in лжесвидетельствовании schlensker , because they allegedly attempted to hide that a retired football coach raping boys .
former presidential candidate john edwards was indicted in financial fraud during the campaign , involving укрывательством extramarital affairs .
stories about the fraud charges on the exams in school and college - this is business as usual .
mentors , who must teach the opposite , send a message that the lies and fraud are acceptable .
in one day , studies show that you can lie from 10 to 200 times .
another study showed that strangers солгали three times for the first 10 minutes to get acquainted with each other .
in contrast to the games room , akin to , say , charades , where you exclaim , " caught ! " identify lies is a serious direction knowledge , based on scientific data , collected over the past six decades in the prestigious universities , comprehensive research projects , particularly in psychology and physiology .
should not be from this it is difficult to draw the conclusion that the liars notice and it is hard to expose .
i spent several years , by examining the scientific discoveries in the vast and ever - growing segment of knowledge about lie detection , and it is clear that modern skill , which is easy to learn and that helps in meaningful in our complex world -- especially if your professional duties include recruiting , interviewing , negotiating or management .
we know from research that extroverts than introverts lied more frequently , that men are more lie about yourself , whereas women -- about the other , usually to protect someone 's feelings that married people lied to its partners , less than unmarried ( but the lie , that they say , often наглая ) .
watch позой laughter , voice features your facility .
rats can fix the upper part of his body when trying to remember their history , they can put their feet towards the door , bend towards the exit , or change its position in a certain way to demonstrate " relief after the interview " -- this exaggerated sigh of relief and a change in posture , when all the complicated issues behind us .
привирающие people can also use disengagement in the speech : " i have n't had sexual relations with that woman miss lewinsky " or repeat a complicated question entirely . ...
someone can use the " qualification " language , when responding to a complex question : " well ... to tell the truth ... as far as i know ... how i know . "
there is no magical means , to expose the lies , deception detection but to master the skill you can .

рафаель эррера chemical faculty unam , researcher , developed a polymer - bitumen , modified to produce a mixture of the best quality , sustainable to the impacts of environmental and temperature .
in his lecture in technological view of the pits , under the international year of chemistry , reported that laboratory , for which he is responsible for developing polymer - modified bitumen mixed with characteristics close to bitumen production , but with the best resistance both high and at low temperatures .
he explained that the bitumen , the toughest part of the oil is a sequence of hydrocarbon molecules , some high - molecular weight , called асфальтенами and other low - molecular weight called мальтенами , which together give the road to cover his tmina вязкоупругое behaviour .
this means that resistance street asphalt is n't constant , and changes during the day , depending on the natural conditions and temperature , specializing in chemical engineering said .
among the most is the upper layers of bitumen , made up of small stones , опущенных in bitumen and then спрессованных .
a movement of vehicles and latch efforts , it helps forces to be distributed on the road to cover very well .
at асфальтовом cover , he added , placed last layer , called a layer of wear and tear , which is made out of the small stone , in fact , the sand also immersed in the asphalt .
as part of pavement , which will receive and distribute these efforts , a layer of wear also requires the proper thickness , and we need to take into consideration the material , from which he is .
when the earth crude , water seeps into the body coverage and it 's hard for her to go from there , it causes размягчение all layers of cover , and therefore education yam .
as a member of the national transportation system , researchers explained that load - this is another important factor in the formation of holes , and therefore the thickness of each layer coating should always be associated with transport load and need to ensure this requirement , to prevent the frequent appearance of yam .

her body was never her advantage , and here she was punished for it .

european champion construction of turbines , from which she receives 30 percent of its electricity , as well as the biggest consumer of coal and gas due to прерывистого due ; the wind which carbon emissions and electricity prices 65 per cent , respectively , and 50 % higher than on average in europe .
as in a globalized economy , the price of energy is a key factor in competitiveness and the keystone of the service of industrial equipment on the national territory , the french companies are benefiting from cheap electricity in europe .
the price that the majority of the french refuse to pay more because they do not oppose in principle , this type of energy .
heavily export - oriented , she attracts a плеяду specialized on international trade in small and medium - sized enterprises and creates a lot of jobs that cannot be moved in another industry .
any engineer electrician will order epr , calculated to work sixty years , if the planned closure of its manufacturer ?
areva decisions with low carbon development , nuclear and renewable energy , testifies взаимодополнимости sources .

both sides see immigration as a burden for the french economy and for the french society .
in his program francois hollande ограничился platitudes , saying that " joint work will solve our immigration problem . "
as ian goldin and jeffrey cameron reminds us economists in a recent book , обобщившей recent data on immigration ( special : how migration shaped our world and people will determine our future , may 2011 , publisher at princeton university , with 352 . ) , there is a broad consensus among experts about the positive impact of migration flows on economic growth , employment and wages in countries that accept immigrants .
fears for the influence of immigrants are based on the view , that they are able to replace local workers , especially for low - skilled , provoking decrease in salaries .
unskilled immigrants work in sectors that do not attract local labor , and the most qualified - in dynamic sectors , where tuition is not connected with offers of work .
just as the surgeon would be hard work in the country , where there is a shortage of анестезиологов complementarity , existing between local and immigrants , leads that the arrival of the immigrants positively affects the wages of local workers .
and this without taking into account the fact that diversity , вносимое immigrants , contributes to new ideas and economic growth ( among american nobel laureates great proportion of naturalised immigrants , and google , intel , paypal and yahoo - were all founded immigrants ) .

we do n't win anything , demanding a series of national referenda , organized as the need and хаотическом alright .
no , we dream not лезвии guillotine , but on the implementation of the joint , clear and uninterrupted - choice and democracy , this time on pan - european level .
the entire europe submits to the dictates of markets and rating agencies , suffers from its weakness and lack of solidarity .
many worry about transfer of sovereignty europe , but whole europe gradually loses its sovereignty , and with each of her nations .
because only joint work europeans can reduce the severity of debt each , extricating itself from the markets , and prepare for the future , investing in it .
after a lengthy discussion of this proposal now require all socialists and jacques delors european economic government .
but to submit it without a stronger economic , political and democratic integration , вошедшей граздан in life , is another madness and a new impasse .
to establish a republic in france , it was necessary to " create a " of republicans .
this can only be done by creating a more democratic europe on the political level , the present popular european sovereignty .
