for around 30 survivors and the relatives of the of the victims attended the hearing .

despite breivik 's strange idea that he is part of the " resistance " movement , the judge ruled that he was not crazy , and said that no evidence that he acted with accomplices .

secretary of defense leon panetta tempers in congress on monday , warning that the automatic budget cuts will undermine national security and will cause financial chain reaction of the pentagon corridors to the fields of battle in afghanistan on the line and the civil assembly .
" the consequences of these reductions will be devastating for the state department , " panetta said in a letter to the senators республиканцу республиканке and john mccain , arizona , lindsey graham of south carolina .
" so , will make such a strong reduction , the majority of our construction projects on кораблестроению and unfulfilled -- you ca n't buy a three - quarters of the ship or the building -- and do serious damage other modernization efforts , " panetta wrote the senators .
" these changes will undermine the credibility of those who support our army and will seriously damage combat readiness . "
" although the foreign military financing in the emergency operations does not directly affected секвестром , the military to be severely affected by a serious breakdown in the main budgets , " panetta warned .
" staff will be reduced , that will lead to the опозданиям staffer with military suppliers , and the legal and political support will be disturbed . "
" the consequences of sequestration in the department of defense will be a rapid decline in the united states as the world 's leading military power . "
" this is not an option , with which we live in , and this is not an option , which we need to impose ourselves . "
whether panetta a letter or the recent warnings of senators will lead to strengthen calls for the release of the pentagon from cuts or budget compromise that will see later .
at a press conference last week secretary of defense painted a gloomy picture of what could be next -- troops from the shell , but without the core .
" with this paper tiger , the army of barracks , buildings and bombs without enough trained soldiers , can accomplish the mission , " panetta said in his introductory remarks in the pentagon .
and panetta said that some of the largest defence projects may face obstacles , including those which passed the tests and some in the early stages of planning .
termination of the further development and testing the f 35 can save $ 80 billion over 10 years , but his supporters say this is the vital next step to improve and to counter potential threats , china and other rivals .
a cursory glance at recent headlines , shows just how serious and повсеместны deception and lies in everyday life .
administration at the university of pennsylvania was charged in лжесвидетельствовании schlensker , because they allegedly attempted to hide that a retired football coach raping boys .

stories about the fraud in the tests in a school and college - it 's the usual thing .
mentors who should teach the opposite , send a message that the lies and fraud are acceptable .
in one day , studies show that you can lie from 10 to 200 times .
another study showed that strangers солгали three times in the first 10 minutes of each other .
unlike in the room of the game , like , say , charades , where you exclaim , " caught ! " detection of lies is a serious direction knowledge , based on scientific data , collected in the past six decades of prestigious universities in comprehensive research projects , particularly in psychology and physiology .
is not out of this it is difficult to draw the conclusion that the liars notice and it is difficult to expose .
i spent several years , examining the scientific discoveries of the vast and ever - growing segment of knowledge about lie detection , and it is clear that the modern skill , which is easy to learn and that helps in our complex in the world -- especially if your professional duties include recruiting , interviewing , negotiating or management .
we know from research that extroverts lied more frequently than introverts , that men lie about yourself , whereas women -- more about the other , usually to protect someone 's feelings , lied to its partners that married people less than unmarried ( but the lie that they say , often наглая ) .
watch позой , laughter , voice characteristics object .
rats can fix the upper part of his body when trying to remember their history , they can put their feet towards the door , bend towards the exit , or change its position in a certain way to demonstrate " relief after the interview " -- this exaggerated sigh of relief and a change in posture , when all the complicated issues behind us .
привирающие people can also use the disengagement in the speech : " i 've never had sexual relations with that woman miss lewinsky ... " or repeat the question entirely .
someone can use the " language " when answering a question : " well ... the truth ... how do i know ... as far as i know . "
there is no magic money , to expose the lie , but to master the skill of deception detection can be .

emma марчегалия , leader of the italian employers ' federation , told reporters after meeting with monti : " we were told that we will actively support this government " .
monti 's chances of success were largely based on the ldp 's support of the party of silvio berlusconi , who was forced to resign on saturday because of the economic crisis .

i think that when you grow , and was some trauma in your life and you lost family member or friend , these events are starting to affect your creativity and your music and of course , these two songs reflect this for me .

during the same period will be necessary to complete a growing scarcity of fossil resources , to continue electricity production all the time , not forgetting the critical need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions , to fight climate imbalance - theme , which disappeared from the environmental debate .
this is why germany is one of them in its decision to abandon its nuclear energy .
on the other hand , great britain , finland , poland , czech republic , the netherlands , sweden , south africa , china , india , brazil is only a few of those who strongly to their projects .
although the model of germany , which is based on the renewable energy , sometimes as an example , the reality belies this argument .
european champion construction of turbines , from which she receives 30 % of its electricity , as well as the biggest consumer of coal and gas прерывистого wind ; because of the carbon emissions and electricity prices 65 per cent , respectively , and on average 50 % higher than in europe .
as in a globalized economy , the price of energy is a key factor in competitiveness and the keystone of the service of industrial equipment on the national territory , the french companies are benefiting from cheap electricity in europe .
the price that the majority of the french refuse to pay more because they have no objection in principle , this type of energy .
heavily export - oriented , it attracts a плеяду specialized in the international trade in small and medium - sized enterprises and create many jobs that may not be moved to another industry .
what engineer and electrician would order the epr , calculated to sixty years , if the planned closure of its manufacturer ?
areva solutions low carbon development , nuclear and renewable energy sources , indicating взаимодополнимости .
in france we have the security body that monitors energy edged and transparent centers such as фламанвиль .
in 50 years ago the nuclear industry has survived three serious of the incident .
device in chernobyl reactor and непростительная human error has led to the tragedy .
the nuclear industry will extract the lessons from this accident , as learned from the two of previous ones .
as it is all the specialists in the field of energy to build a reactor , halt its construction in фламанвиле will be a great gift to areva and edf , menacing them ​​путь toward the conquest of leadership in the imminent development of nuclear energy .
then the administrative harassment of foreign students , which in the news , when the minister of interior ( " либерасьон " from france on may 23 ) said that " do n't need foreign talent , bricklayers and waiters . "
immigration on both sides of the see the burden for the french economy and for the french society .
in its programme in francois hollande ограничился platitudes , saying that " joint work will solve our immigration . "
as ian goldin and remind us economists jeffrey cameron in a recent book обобщившей recent data on immigration ( special : how migration shaped our world and people determine our future , may 2011 , at princeton university , with 352 . ) , a broad consensus among experts about the positive impact of migration flows , wages and employment growth in countries that accept immigrants .
fears for the influence of the immigrants based on the view that they can replace the local workers , especially for low - skilled , provoking cuts in wages .
unskilled immigrants work in sectors that do not attract local labor , and the most skilled in the dynamic sectors , where training is not connected with the offers of work .
just as the surgeon would be hard work in the country , where there is a shortage of анестезиологов , complementarity between local and immigrants that the arrival of the immigrants , leads to positively affect the salaries of local workers .
and it is without taking into account the fact that diversity , вносимое immigrants , contributes to new ideas and economic growth ( among american nobel laureates -- large share of naturalised immigrants , and google , intel , paypal and yahoo were all immigrants are based ) .
according to the organization of labor , for example , in germany , an immigrant , arrived at the age of 30 years , for his life will bring to the state budget net profit ( revenue minus expenses ) in an average of 150,000 euros .
the teeth , which used to scare immigrants , gave exactly the opposite effect .
democracy is the most valuable acquisition ; but it at the same time , and fragile .
some thought that democracy has triumphed over their enemies , a vote and make it as straight as possible .
universal vote , though it is essential to democracy , it is not sufficient condition and may even become a tool of suppression " , as republican once philosopher etienne вашро said .
the european crisis , which we are experiencing , is an economic crisis , but in the first of all this political crisis and the crisis of democracy .
we win nothing , demanding series of national referenda , organized as needed and хаотическом .
no , we are dreaming not лезвии guillotine , but on the implementation of the joint , clear and constant - choice and democracy , this time on level .
the entire europe is subject to the dictates of markets and rating agencies , suffers from their own weakness and lack of solidarity .
many worry about transfer europe , but the whole europe gradually loses its sovereignty , and with each of her nations .
because only a collaborative effort of the europeans will be able to reduce the severity of debt of each , free markets and prepare for the future , investing in him .
after a lengthy discussion of this socialist proposals and jacques delors now require all of the european economic government .
but to submit it without a stronger economic , political and democratic integration , вошедшей граздан in life , is another madness and a new impasse .
to establish the republic of france , it was necessary " to create the " republican .
it can only be done through the creation of a more democratic europe on the political level , this popular of the european sovereignty .
in fact , the 2011 year end sales microprocessors ( 11 % rise in the world bank cards , mobile phones with sim cards ) , above , according to the eurosmart , 6 thousand million .

analysis of the place calls , has pointed out several находившихся in mali , niger and nigeria .
" this is a step forward , but of course , we need to wait for more reliable evidence , before you talk about the operational cooperation between the aqmi and boko haram . "
" for many years , we know that the sect идейную and receives financial support from the outside and that it is becoming more and more active , " says кунле амуво , nigeria researcher .
the international community led by washington now puts pressure on абуджу to attention problems , that creates the boko haram .
it focused mainly on the churches , bars and authorities .
in last christmas she took responsibility for per share , in which 80 people were killed in джосе , and then another one in abuja .

mitt romney , who has the best chances of nomination from the " good old party , has threatened to sue the chinese complaint to the wto and accuse them of manipulating its currency is a sensitive issue for america , migration is as much as their industries to asia .
john huntsman , former obama ambassador to china and the only candidate , the complex foreign policy could not overcome position that потакает emotions .
but the huntsman , who has been in the bottom of the ratings , has remained in неуслышанным .
romney has also promised the military strikes against iran if sanctions will not be able to halt its nuclear program .
" if obama will be re - elected , they will have a bomb . "
entrepreneur херман kane , the second in the ranking candidates demonstrated the daunting ignorance of the cases .
the texas governor rick perry , who supports israel and to the military strikes on iran , says that he was ready to use the us army against drug cartels in mexico .
all this is a far cry from the republican candidate john mccain 's 2008 , тяжеловеса foreign policy .
they remind us that obama was himself a lover and that he had to lower the tone in the respect of the fight against terror .
after iraq did not believe it is in the military intervention that увязают in the sand .
