pri ruled mexico for seven decades until it lost the presidency in 2000 .
calderon , national action party candidate , or ipa , headed by her brother , refused to acknowledge вальехо winner .
ауреолес also refused to accept the preliminary results .

for the pri , however , no matter how badly looked elections in michoacan , victory will give momentum behind the party .
раджат naga , the managing director of the adb 's office in manila , said the two emerging big economies must " do everything that can " to accelerate the recovery of the currency bloc with the international monetary fund or direct bilateral agreements .
" asia can be protected to some extent , but it may not be immune . "
the european monetary union was undermined by the european debt crisis in recent months .
unfolding in europe 's debt crisis has spawned fears that he could bring the world economy into recession again , and led to calls for the leading emerging economies come together to help the eurozone find a solution .
anand sharma , india 's trade minister , said that " india will do everything that can " to help the eurozone , as its own economy is now declining exports and inflows of foreign capital .
" we have ambitious goals , and we must maintain a high level of growth . "
others argue that there is no sense for emerging economies like india to help wealthy europeans , when they face their own deep economic problems .
" at some point they recognize that the greeks are retiring at the age of 50 and go on holidays to the sea , and it will not be taken well , " he said .
mr. нэг , said the eurozone crisis threatened " significant direct effects throughout asia . "

defense secretary leon panetta tempers in congress on monday , warning that the automatic budget cuts will undermine national security and the financial chain reaction of the pentagon corridors to the fields of battle in afghanistan on the line and civil assembly .
" the impact these cuts would be devastating for the state department , " panetta said in a letter to senators республиканке республиканцу john mccain , arizona and lindsey graham of south carolina .
" so , make a cut , the majority of our construction projects on кораблестроению and unfulfilled -- you ca n't buy a three - quarters of the ship or the building -- and do serious damage other modernization efforts , " panetta wrote senators .
" these changes undermine trust , who supports our army and will seriously damage боеготовности . "
" while foreign military financing in the emergency operations does not directly affected секвестром , the military to be severely affected by serious breakdown in the main budgets , " panetta warned .
" staff will be reduced , resulting in опозданиям staffer with military suppliers , and legal and political support will be compromised " .
" the consequences of sequestration in the department of defense will be rapid decline in the united states as the world 's leading military power . "
" this is not an option , with which we live in , and this is not an option that we need to impose ourselves . "
whether panetta letter senators or recent warnings will lead to strengthen calls for the release of the pentagon from cuts or budget compromise , will see later .
at a press conference last week secretary of defense painted a gloomy picture of what could be next -- troops from the shell , but without the core .
" this paper tiger , the army to barracks , buildings and bombs without enough trained soldiers able to accomplish the mission , " panetta said in his introductory remarks in the pentagon .
and panetta said that some of the largest defence projects may face obstacles , including those which passed the tests and some in the early stages of planning .
stopping further development and testing the f 35 can save $ 80 billion over 10 years , but his supporters say this is the vital next step to improve and address potential threats from china and other adversaries .
a cursory glance at recent headlines , shows just how serious and повсеместны deception and lies in everyday life .
the administration at the university of pennsylvania was charged in лжесвидетельствовании schlensker , because they allegedly made that retired football coach raped boys .
former presidential candidate john edwards was charged in the financial machinations during the campaign , involving укрывательством extramarital affairs .
stories of fraud on the tests in school and college is the norm .
mentors who should teach the opposite , send a message that the lies and fraud are acceptable .
in one day , studies show that you can lie from 10 to 200 times .
another study showed that strangers солгали three times in the first 10 minutes of each other .
unlike in the room of the game , like , say , charades , where you exclaim , " caught ! " detection of lies is a serious direction knowledge , based on scientific data , collected in the past six decades of prestigious universities in comprehensive research projects , particularly in psychology and physiology .
not worth of hard to notice and it is difficult to draw the conclusion that liars .
i spent several years , examining the scientific discoveries of the vast and ever - growing segment of knowledge about lie detection , and it is clear that the modern skill , which is easy to learn and that helps in our complex in the world -- especially if your professional duties include recruiting , interviewing , negotiating or management .
we know from research that extroverts lied more frequently than introverts , that men lie about yourself , whereas women -- more about the other , usually in order to protect someone 's feelings , lied to its partners that married people less than unmarried ( but the lie that they say , often наглая ) .
watch позой , laughter , voice your subject characteristics .
rats can secure the top of his body when trying to remember their history , they can put their feet towards the door , bend towards the exit , or change its position in a certain way to demonstrate " relief after the interview " -- this exaggerated sigh of relief and a change in posture , when all the complicated issues behind us .
привирающие people can also use the disengagement in the speech : " i 've never had sexual relations with that woman miss lewinsky ... " or repeat the question entirely .
someone can use the " language " when answering a question : " well ... the truth ... how do i know ... as far as i know . "
there is no magical means to detect lies , but to master the skill of deception detection .

in his lecture in technological view of the pits , under the international year of chemistry , reported that laboratory , for which he is responsible for developing polymer - modified bitumen mixed with characteristics close to the bitumen production , but with the best opposition , both in high and low temperatures .
he explained that the bitumen , the most difficult part of the oil is a sequence of hydrocarbon molecules , some high - molecular weight , called асфальтенами and other low - molecular weight called мальтенами , which together give the road to cover his характерное вязкоупругое behaviour .
this means that the resistance street asphalt is not constant , and changes in the day , depending on the natural conditions and temperature , said an expert in chemical engineering .
among the top of the layers of bitumen is made of small stones , опущенных спрессованных bitumen and then .
when vehicles and прикладывании efforts , it helps forces of very well be on the road to cover .

the basic idea and chancellor of the draft resolution expresses the slogan : answer to the crisis - not less europe " , but more europe " .
in any case , it is one of the proposals of the draft resolution , adopted by congress , an idea , obviously , belongs to вольфгангу schaeuble .
to calm the situation in his party , the chancellor increased the number of references to the konrad adenauer and helmut kohl , but it has not sought to influence congress at the expense of " small " european countries or , in the plight of that love to criticize the " arrogant " , germany .

if these figures compare with figures of european neighbors , it seems that french workers not more likely to take sick employees than any other country .
the level of fraud linked to sick leave , very low compared to the " grey " employment .
stricter law since 2002 led to systematic проверке hospital lasting more than 45 days .

spain came under fire in the markets before the parliamentary election on sunday .
insee , despite this , to reduce the numbers in the second quarter , with the fall of 0.1 per cent of gross domestic product ( gdp ) instead of stagnation .
germany , in turn , the growth of 0.5 % over the same period .
if there is a theme , the decision which cannot be taken after the short discussion or under the influence of the emotions , is an energy policy .
this is a healthy trend that electoral meeting place , and become an occasion for reflection on the share of their nuclear energy .
france must build their opinion on objective facts and data on the rational .
during the same period will be necessary to complete a growing scarcity of fossil resources to continue electricity production time , not forgetting the critical need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to fight climate imbalance - theme that disappeared from the environmental debate .
that is why germany is one in its decision to abandon nuclear energy .
on the other hand , britain , finland , poland , czech republic , netherlands , sweden , south africa , china , india , brazil is just a few of those who resolutely keeps his projects .
although the german model based on renewable energy , sometimes cited as an example , the reality belies this argument .
european champion construction of turbines , which she receives 30 percent of its electricity , as well as the biggest consumer of coal and gas due to wind прерывистого ; because of the carbon dioxide emissions and electricity prices by 65 per cent , respectively , and on average 50 % higher than in europe .
as the price of energy in a globalized economy a key factor in competitiveness and the service of industrial equipment in the national territory , the french company benefiting from cheap electricity in europe .
the price that the majority of the french refuse to pay more because they have no objection in principle , this type of energy .
heavily export - oriented , it attracts a плеяду specialized in the international trade in small and medium enterprises and create many jobs that may not be moved to another industry .
what engineer and electrician would order the epr , calculated to sixty years , if the planned closure of its manufacturer ?
development of low - carbon solutions by areva , nuclear and renewable energy , testifies взаимодополнимости sources .
in france we have the security body that monitors existing edged and transparent energy centres , such as the фламанвиль .
for 50 years , the nuclear industry has survived three serious incident .
in the chernobyl reactor and unforgivable human error led to tragedy .
nuclear industry извлечет lessons from this accident as the learned from the previous two .
as it is all specialists in the field of energy to build the reactor , will halt its construction in фламанвиле gorgeous gift competitors areva and edf , menacing them ​​путь toward the conquest of leadership in the imminent development of nuclear energy .
then the administrative harassment of foreign students , which in the news , when the minister of interior ( " либерасьон " from france on may 23 ) said that " do n't need foreign talent , bricklayers and waiters . "
both sides see the burden for the french economy and immigration for french society .
in his program francois hollande ограничился platitudes , saying that " joint work will solve our immigration problem . "
as ian goldin and remind us economists jeffrey cameron in a recent book обобщившей recent data on immigration ( special : how migration shaped our world and people determine our future , may 2011 , at princeton university , with 352 . ) , a broad consensus among experts about the positive impact of migration flows , wages and employment growth in countries that accept immigrants .
fears the influence of immigrants based on the view that they can replace local workers , especially skilled , provoking decrease in salaries .
unskilled immigrants work in sectors that do not attract local labor , and the most skilled in the dynamic sectors , where training is not linked to the proposals .
just as the surgeon would be hard work in the country , where there is a shortage of анестезиологов , complementarity between local and immigrants that the arrival of the immigrants , leads to positively affect the salaries of local workers .
and this without taking into account the fact that diversity , вносимое immigrants , to create new ideas and economic growth ( among american nobel laureates large share of naturalised immigrants , and google , intel , paypal and yahoo were all immigrants are based ) .
labor organization estimates that in germany , for example , the immigrant , arrived at the age of 30 years , life will bring state budget net profit ( revenue minus expenses ) in an average of 150,000 euros .
the teeth , which used to scare immigrants , gave exactly the opposite effect .
democracy is fragile and valuable acquisition ; but at the same time .
some thought that democracy has triumphed over their enemies , enough to vote and make it as direct as possible .
universal vote , though it is essential to democracy , it is not sufficient condition and may even be a " tool of suppression " , as republican once philosopher etienne вашро said .
the european crisis that we are , is the economic crisis , but first , this political crisis and democracy .
we do n't win anything , demanding a series of national referendums , organized as needed and хаотическом .
no , we are dreaming not лезвии guillotine , but on the implementation of the joint , clear and constant - choice and democracy , this time on level .
the entire europe submits to the dictates of markets and rating agencies , suffers from its weakness and lack of solidarity .
many worry about the transfer of sovereignty , europe , but the entire europe gradually loses its sovereignty , and with each of its nations .
because only collaborative effort of the europeans will reduce the severity of the debt each , free markets and prepare for the future , investing in it .
after a lengthy discussion of this proposal now require all socialists and jacques delors european economic government .
